        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
          Metascript is an open source tool that provides a basic textual
          analysis framework for the comparison of an original text (novels,
          short stories, etc.) and its film transposition (screenplays). The
          goal of Metascript is to provide a set of guidelines for the markup
          and the metadata enrichment among multimodal texts, such as a book
          with its screenplay adaptation for audiovisual transposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metascript also enables the alignment of the marked texts with the
          final visual rendering of the film through the use of timestamps
          inherited from subtitles files, allowing for the visualization of the
          different portions of the texts in its different versions, both
          textual and visual, paired with analysis of the colors and of the
          scenic rendering of the narrative passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example used as a working prototype for the project is Arthur
          Schnitzler&#39;s novel &quot;Dream Story&quot; and the two screenplays
          (a &#39;96 draft and a &#39;99 transcript) from the film &quot;Eyes
          Wide Shut&quot;, a transposition of Schnitzler&#39;s novel directed by
          Stanley Kubrick and adapted by Kubrick himself alongside with Frederic
          Raphael.
        </p>
        <p>The development of Metascript has followed three macro-stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The creation of the XML-TEI encodings of the different texts (with a
            particular attention for the implementation of Linked Open Data)
          </li>
          <li>The extraction of relevant data using python scripts</li>
          <li>
            The analysis of the data and the graphical visualization of the
            results
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Metascript aims to answer the call for the development of a working
          model of digital textual analysis related to film screenplays, a niche
          literary class of texts whose digital applications and methodologies
          have not yet been studied and/or applied thoroughly. Our project wants
          to stand as an initial model and reference guideline for the encoding
          of screenplays, and in particular for the ones that spur from the
          adaptation of more classical literary texts. In this sense, Metascript
          is set to create an encoding model that connects the different text
          and audiovisual mediums, aligning elements such as scenes, characters
          and places between them; for example, characters whose names, gender
          or other peculiarities have been changed in the adaptation from the
          book to the screenplay are aligned in a way that allows for the
          changes to bee tracked among the transmodality of the texts. The same
          thing is done for paragraphs of the book that have been translated in
          specific scenes of the screenplay. Metascript enables the reader to
          navigate these scenes and explore the differences between the original
          text and its adaptation, from a narrative and textual point of view
          but also visually, by enabling an easy alignment with the film itself,
          and its corresponding visual frames.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to XML-TEI tagging and text alignment work, special
          attention is given to the inclusion of metadata and linked open data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further goal of the project is to be able to extrapolate
          quantitative data from the texts, capable of providing insights on the
          changes and/or similarities among them. In our prototype, we chose to
          extrapolate data regarding the relationships between characters
          through the use of Python scripts. A network analysis of this data has
          subsequently been produced using libraries such as networkX and Bokeh
          to concretely visualize the results and answer some research
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same thing was done in relation to geographic data, utilizing the
          libraries xml.etree and folium.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, one last analysis was performed in relation to the space and
          time data of the single scenes from the screenplay to quantify the
          percentages of the scenes that have been shot at night rather than
          during the day, indoors or outdoors.
        </p>

        <h3>The source material</h3>
        <p>
          In choosing the working material on which to set our prototype, we
          conducted extensive research around film transpositions derived from
          books.
        </p>
        <p>
          One well-known director who often relied on novels in the creation of
          his films was Stanley Kubrick. Therefore, we decided to analyze his
          filmography and trace back to the original texts from which he started
          his adaptations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the titles that most attracted our attention were Lolita, Eyes
          Wide Shut, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon, and Full Metal Jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our final choice fell on Eyes Wide Shut and its corresponding novel
          &quot;Dream Story&quot; (original language &quot;Traumnovelle&quot;)
          for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the availability of the html and txt texts of the screenplay and the
            book
          </li>
          <li>
            the presence of interesting changes implemented by the director in
            terms of space and time
          </li>
          <li>
            the particular use of color and outdoor/indoor spaces in the film
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The chosen source materials are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the novel &quot;Dream Story&quot; translated by Otto P. Schinnerer
            from the original German &quot;Traumnovelle&quot; by author Arthur
            Schnitzler, published by Green Integer (Los Angeles)
          </li>
          <li>
            the 1996 draft screenplay of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; written by
            Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael
          </li>
          <li>
            the 1999 transcript of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; published on
            October 1, 1999 by Grand Central Pub (New York)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The ‘96 draft and the ‘99 transcription are very similar, but have
          some differences on various scenes that were later cut or changed by
          the director. In addition, the ‘96 draft is incomplete in that it is
          missing some scenes that were later included in the final version of
          the film.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from these minor differences in content, the two texts are
          otherwise formally the same. Respecting the look and layout rules of a
          film script (capitalized names before each line of dialogue, scene
          setting introducing the place and light characterizing the moment of
          the scene etc.). These particularities led us to think carefully about
          how we could mark this text type correctly and in an efficient way.
        </p>

        <h3>The competency questions</h3>
        <p>
          Starting from the reading of the source materials, we defined some
          research questions to better visualize the goals of the project:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How can we simply and directly compare the various scenes in the
            film with the corresponding moments in the original book, so as to
            highlight their fidelity and changes?
          </li>
          <li>
            What differences exist at the level of characters and their
            relationships within the book and the screenplay? What about between
            the &#39;96 draft and the final &#39;99 version? Do they reflect or
            highlight changes?
          </li>
          <li>
            How does the geographical setting of events change between book and
            film?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which scenes and passages in the book occur during the day, and
            which occur at night? Do moments set outside in the book remain so
            in the film, and vice versa?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Workflow scheme</h3>
        <p>
          From the research questions posed, it quickly became clear that we
          needed to follow a clear workflow to achieve our goals step by step.

        <h3>Data Modeling</h3>
        <p>
          After having defined the workflow, we started modeling the data to
          understand how to formalize all the relationships used inside the
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The structure of the data model was inspired by the one created for
          the “National Edition of Aldo Moro’s Works”<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          We modeled the data starting from the basic element, the RDF
          statement, constituted by a triple that represents subject, predicate,
          object. Subject and predicate are always represented by a URI, while
          the object can be an URI or a literal value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the formalization offered by
          <a href="http://purl.org/spar/frbr">FRBR</a> (Functional Requirements
          for Bibliographic Records) and, consequently,
          <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio">FABiO</a> (FRBR-aligned
          Bibliographic Ontology) was used to describe the elements of our
          project as codependent from one another:
        </p>
        <p>
          - <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Work">fabio:Work</a> refers to
          the general concepts of the book “Dream Story” and of the movie
          transposition “Eyes Wide Shut”.
        </p>
        <p>
          -
          <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Expression">fabio:expression</a>,
          the intellectual content, in our case is the translated version of the
          book, the draft screenplay and the transcription of the movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          -
          <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Manifestation"
            >fabio:manifestation</a
          >
          is the materialization of the entity, in our case the book version
          that has been published by Green Integer, the XML-TEI encodings, the
          transcription of the movie published in 1999 and the draft screenplay.
        </p>
        <p class="img-container">
          <img
            src="./img/frbr_model.drawio.png"
            referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
            alt="img"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose to use FABiO as the core ontology for this project because it
          describes “entities that are published or potentially publishable, and
          that contain or are referred to by bibliographic references, or
          entities used to define such bibliographic references”<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used other ontologies to formalize the relationships between the
          entity and its metadata or between entities as shown in the table
          below.

        <h2>XML-TEI ENCODING</h2>
        <p>
          The next step was the encoding of the three texts using
          <a href="https://tei-c.org/">XML-TEI</a>. XML is a metalanguage, a
          basis for other standards and can be easily transformed in another
          format. TEI is used for the digital representation of texts and its
          specifications allow the encoding of different types of text (i.e.,
          screenplays, novels, poetry). The goal of the XML-TEI is to encode the
          texts both from a logical and a semantic point of view, using tags to
          make explicit the structure of the text and add metadata that can be
          useful for a standardized and immediate interpretation, but also to
          extract information and analyze it.
        </p>
        <h3>The TEI header</h3>
        <p>
          The TEI header serves as a repository for metadata related to the
          encoded text. In our project, the TEI header consists of three main
          sections:
        </p>

              triple, followed by additional tags expressing the predicate and

              URI resource derived from a thesaurus or authoritative coding

            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/es/html/ref-docTitle.html"
            >&lt;docTitle&gt;</a
          >
          tag serves to contain details about the book&#39;s title, while the
          <a
            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/es/html/ref-byline.html"
            >&lt;byline&gt;</a
          >
          tag holds the primary statement of responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each chapter within the book is divided using a
          <a
            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/es/html/ref-div.html"
            >&lt;div&gt;</a
          >
          tag, along with specifications for its type and sequential number. In
          cases where text portions, which may or may not align with chapters,
          relate to scenes from the &#39;99 transcription, we include a tag to
          label them with a type attribute set to &quot;scene&quot; and an
          &quot;n&quot; attribute to correspond to the scene in the
          transcription. Furthermore, each portion is uniquely identified using
          an id attribute. This division is crucial for creating a direct
          comparison among the three texts on the website and is aligned in a
          macro-XML file known as "alignment.xml".
        </p>
        <p>
          To mark citations in the text, we manually inserted the
          <a
            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/es/html/ref-quote.html"
            >&lt;quote&gt;</a
          >
          tag where appropriate. We employed a generic
          <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-rs.html"
            >&lt;rs&gt;</a
          >
          tag, followed by an attribute specifying the type of person mentioned,
          such as character or real person, along with an id to uniquely
          identify the character referenced in the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          For dialogues, we employed the
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-said.html"
            >&lt;said&gt;</a
          >
          tag, providing specific attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "aloud" is set to true if the speech is said out loud, and false if
            it is not.
          </li>
          <li>
            "direct" indicates whether the speech is presented in a direct or
            indirect manner.
          </li>
          <li>"who" refers to the speaker.</li>
          <li>"toWhom" identifies the listener.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Multiple speakers or listeners are added as a single string and
          separated with a comma.
        </p>
        <h3>Screenplay Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          Being screenplays already loosely schematised texts, we were able to
          develop a set of scripts to help automate the process of mark-up. This
          was achieved with the use of the
          <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/"
            >BeautifulSoup library</a
          >
          to deal with the original files (an html file for the 1996 screenplay
          and a txt file in the case of the transcription) which have been
          parsed using regular expressions to identify patterns in the files
          that were subsequently translated in the respective XML/TEI-compliant
          tags for each one of the descriptive elements of the screenplays and
          for the additional metadata elements. These scripts were able to cut
          the time that would have been spent manually encoding the texts by a
          lot; unfortunately, the original screenplay files found on the
          internet were not flawlessly formatted, presenting many errors in the
          layout of the pages. This effectively decreased the efficiency of the
          parsing scripts, as we were forced to correct these sporadic errors by
          hand after the encoding of the whole files.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of the screenplay of the movie&#39;s transcription, we
          were able to enrich the TEI encoding of the text by adding a timestamp
          related to the start and to the end of each of the speech tags of the
          text as they appear in the movie itself. These timestamps were
          automatically extracted, using again a Python script, from a subtitle
          file for the movie, which has been parsed and matched with each of the
          &quot;sp&quot; elements of the marked-up file using the
          <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz">TheFuzz library</a> for
          fuzzy string matching.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final screenplay encoding adheres to the guidelines provided by
          the TEI consortium for correctly tagging performance texts<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup
          ><sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the header, the &quot;front&quot; tag is employed to store
          information about the cast members within the
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-castList.html"
            >&lt;castlist&gt;</a
          >, with each cast member&#39;s details enclosed within a
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-castItem.html"
            >&lt;castItem&gt;</a
          >
          tag. For each &lt;castItem&gt;, the character&#39;s name is defined
          using the
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-role.html"
            >&lt;role&gt;</a
          >
          tag, and a concise description is included using
          <a
            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-roleDesc.html"
            >&lt;roleDesc&gt;</a
          >. To specify the actor portraying the character in the film, the
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-actor.html"
            >&lt;actor&gt;</a
          >
          tag is used, and each tag contains a reference to the unique
          identifier provided by IMDB. The information contained within the
          &quot;actor&quot; tag was automatically extracted using a script,
          significantly reducing the time required for this task. This Python
          script leveraged the
          <a href="https://pypi.org/project/imdby/">IMDb library</a> to retrieve
          the names of all cast members involved in the film adaptation, along
          with their respective roles. Subsequently, this data was saved in both
          CSV and JSON formats for further use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every scene is tagged with a &lt;div&gt;, indicating its type and
          scene number, along with a unique identifier. If a scene corresponds
          to one or more scenes in the transcription, an additional &lt;div&gt;
          is added, containing information about which scene(s) in the
          transcription match the given scene.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Stage directions are marked using the
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-stage.html"
            >&lt;scene&gt;</a
          >
          tag and feature various attributes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            &quot;environment&quot; specifies whether the setting is internal or
            external.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;primary_location&quot; denotes the general location of the
            scene.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;secondary_location&quot; provides more specific location
            details, such as a particular room.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;time&quot; conveys information about the temporal setting of
            the scene.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Additional stage directions are also included using the
          &quot;stage&quot; tag but with distinct attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &quot;setting&quot; offers further details about the scene&#39;s
            setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;delivery&quot; is employed when the director provides
            directions on how the scene should be performed by the actor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each line of dialogue is tagged as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The line is enclosed within a
            <a
              href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-sp.html"
              >&lt;sp&gt;</a
            >
            tag, which specifies the speaker and listener using the same
            attributes as those employed in the book.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the transcription, the<a
              href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-timeline.html"
              >&lt;timeline&gt;
            </a>
            tag specifies the start and end running times of the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
            <a
              href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-speaker.html"
              >&lt;speaker&gt;</a
            >
            tag identifies the speaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
            <a
              href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-p.html"
              >&lt;p&gt;</a
            >
            tag contains the actual dialogue line.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Macro-XML</h3>
        <p>
          We have chosen to create two additional XML files, namely
          &quot;characters.xml&quot; and &quot;alignment.xml,&quot; to
          facilitate the alignment of characters and narrative correspondences
          among the three texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For character alignment, we have compiled lists of characters that
          were previously defined in the TEI headers of the texts. These
          character lists are combined in &quot;characters.xml.&quot; All
          correspondences between different characters are encapsulated within a
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-linkGrp.html"
          ></a>
          element. The
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/it/html/ref-link.html"
          ></a>
          tag is employed to establish hypertextual associations, in this case,
          aligning the character IDs from the book with their counterparts in
          the draft screenplay and transcription.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the alignment of narrative correspondences, we based it on
          the transcription as the primary text from which we derived the others
          and identified relative correspondences. We divided the book into
          sections using a &lt;div&gt; element, corresponding to scenes in the
          transcription. Each section was assigned a unique identifier (ID) that
          corresponds to a specific portion of text. The same process was
          applied to align the draft screenplay with the transcription.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the XML file, we used <link /> tags, as mentioned previously, to
          align the IDs of corresponding scenes among the three texts. When it
          is possible to compare only two texts due to a lack of correspondence
          in the third, the text without the relevant correspondence is omitted.
        </p>

        <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the analyses conducted in this project is to
          facilitate the comprehension of dispersed information within a text,
          while also helping the comparison of the three core texts under
          analysis. This is crucial for gaining an immediate understanding of
          how the adaptation has evolved from the original, encompassing not
          only stylistic changes but also alterations in setting and character
          interactions. We have opted to perform these analyses because they
          enable a simultaneous reading and comparison that may not be readily
          apparent if only one of the texts is read.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analyses that we have chosen to conduct are the following<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a></sup
          >:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spatial analysis of the places mentioned in the book and in the
            transcription of the movie.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network analysis, analyzing the network of characters’ interactions
            between the three texts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spatio-temporal analysis of the transcription, analyzing which
            combination of environment-time is more used in the text.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The main goal in doing a spatial analysis in this project was both to
          visualize and compare the places in which the book and the screenplay
          take place. In our case “Traumnovelle” and “Eyes Wide Shut” are set in
          two different cities, and in the movie, the places in which scenes
          take place are not specified. This tool can be more useful if in both
          texts there are specifications about the settings, and in this way the
          differences are more relevant and useful for a comparison. The goal of
          this script is to automate as much as possible the creation of the
          map, automatically adding circles corresponding to city areas and
          points to other types of geographical elements<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a></sup
          >. Unfortunately, there is still the need to manually insert GeoJSON
          files corresponding to regions, states, or country areas that we want
          to display on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The python libraries needed to extract information from the TEI
          document and visualize them inside a map are respectively
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"
            >xml.etree</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/#"
            >folium</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>xml.etree</strong> is used to progressively search into the
          hierarchical structure of the XML-TEI document. In this case we need
          to search inside the TEI header the content inside the tag
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-place.html"
          ></a
          >. Then we create a dictionary in which the content of
          <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-placeName.html"
          ></a>
          and of the attribute &quot;type&quot; constitute a tuple that
          represents the key of the dictionary, while the coordinates are the
          value of the dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Folium</strong> leverages the Leaflet.js JavaScript library to
          generate maps directly in a Python environment. It is used here to
          create the map, manually specifying the focus on a specific area from
          which we want to start our visualization. Through an iteration inside
          the dictionary, if the &#39;type&#39; attribute corresponds to
          &#39;city&#39;, a circle is drawn around the coordinates defined in
          the XML-TEI document, if it is not the case, then only a point is
          added in correspondence of the value of the dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering that we want to visualize the areas corresponding to
          regions/countries/states, we need to find the corresponding GeoJSON
          files and manually load them one by one into the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we save the map as an html file that can be embedded inside the
          main website for visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the analysis we can conclude that Schnitzler set the book mainly
          in Vienna and was extremely precise from a spatial point of view,
          mentioning specific cafes, hotels and relevant locations within the
          city. On the other hand, in the adaptation, Kubrick sets the scene in
          New York and doesn’t delve into much details about the actual
          locations, he generally mentions a general setting (i.e. a costume
          shop), without specifying its exact location. Consequently, in this
          example, we can readily discern the contrasting city settings, but we
          are unable to make similarly detailed comparisons for specific
          locations within the story.
        </p>

        <h3>Network Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The goal in doing a characters network analysis is to analyze the
          number of interactions that the characters have inside the story, and
          simultaneously do a comparison between interactions in the story,
          draft screenplay and the transcription of the screenplay (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
          For each of the XML documents analyzed we have created the following:
          a CSV file containing the interactions; a static graph; an interactive
          graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The libraries needed to extract information from the TEI document,
          visualize it in a static graph and then in a dynamic one are:
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"
            >xml.etree</a
          >, <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a>,
          <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>xml.etree</strong> is used to search inside the TEI header the
          content inside the tag &quot;said&quot; or &quot;sp&quot; and get all
          the information contained in the tags “who” and “toWhom”. This process
          is done for each &quot;said&quot; or &quot;sp&quot; tag and then the
          information is added in a list. The script finds if speakers or
          listeners are more than one (so separated by a comma), splits them,
          adds them into a list. A dictionary is used to store the number of
          times the characters interact with each other, counting the number of
          times the tuple is inside the list.
        </p>
        <p>Then, we store the data into an external CSV file.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>NetworkX</strong> is used to visualize the data extracted from
          the XML-TEI in a static network graph. The data previously created is
          stored in CSV files and is now used to create a data frame using
          <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> library. Then data
          inside the columns &quot;Character&quot; and &quot;Listener&quot; are
          transformed into nodes and their relationship through edges by the
          library. Labels are added to clearly visualize the relationships
          between speaker and listener.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values are then sorted in a descending order, highlighting the
          characters that have more interactions inside the text, then a bar
          graph has been created to visualize the 10 characters that have
          interacted the most throughout the narration.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Bokeh</strong></p>
        <p>
          In the pursuit of crafting interactive visualizations for the network
          analysis graphs of the three distinct texts, we adopted the Python
          library Bokeh. Bokeh stands out for its extensive customization
          capabilities, offering an array of plots tailored to specific needs.
          Using as inspiration the procedural steps outlined in
          <em>Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python</em
          ><sup><a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></sup
          >, we undertook our project with Bokeh, exploiting the data sourced
          from CSV files containing character relationships in the texts.
          Bokeh&#39;s remarkable versatility enabled us to thoroughly tailor the
          graphical representations to our precise requirements. Subsequently,
          we saved the resulting visualizations as HTML files, making them
          readily deployable for online uploading. Furthermore, Bokeh&#39;s
          inherent functionality empowers external users to dynamically
          manipulate the visualizations and export them in PNG format to their
          local devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our analysis yielded insights into the evolution of character
          nomenclature and interaction networks across various adaptations of
          the original literary work. Notably, we observed that character names
          underwent significant modifications, &#39;americanizing&#39; several
          character names to align with a global audience, particularly in the
          case of key protagonists. To illustrate, an examination of Arthur
          Schnitzler&#39;s &quot;Dream Story&quot; revealed a narrative
          characterized by a relatively modest cast of characters, with the
          majority of relationships converging upon the central figure,
          Fridolin. In contrast, an analysis of the 1996 screenplay draft
          demonstrated a deliberate expansion of character relationships and
          dialogues, accompanied by the introduction of numerous secondary
          characters. Furthermore, this adaptation witnessed a noteworthy
          process of name adaptation, &#39;americanizing&#39; several character
          names to attract an international audience. The final 1999 script
          transcript marked the climax of narrative expansion, as a plethora of
          secondary characters orbited around the principal character, Bill, who
          emerged as the central storytelling focal point. Only a select trio of
          characters (Alice, Milich, and Nick) established secondary
          relationships that did not intersect with our central protagonist.
          This exploration not only underscores the malleability of character
          names in adaptation but also elucidates the dynamic transformations
          and amplifications of interpersonal networks within the context of
          literary adaptations.

        <h3>Spatio-Temporal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          This analysis gives an idea of the prevalent time and space setting,
          extracting the stage directions that the director had written on the
          screenplay. The libraries needed to extract information from the TEI
          document and visualize graphically the data are:
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"
            >xml.etree</a
          >
          and <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">Plotly</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>xml.etree</strong> is used to search inside the TEI header the
          content inside the tag &quot;stage&quot; two specific attributes which
          content is stored in lists. A list of tuples is created, where each
          tuple contains the information of time setting and related
          environment. We iterate over the list, and use a dictionary to count
          the occurrences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plotly</strong> is a library used to create interactive graphs
          based on the data that we have extracted before. In this case we
          wanted to represent our data with a pie chart that represents the
          percentage of space/time settings. The values of the dictionary, so
          the occurrences, are stored into a list, and then automatically
          transformed into percentage values.
        </p>
        <p>
          This analysis concludes that the prevalent setting of the movie is in
          an internal space at night.

        <h2>WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>
          The web application built to showcase the project has been developed
          with HTML, CSS and Javascript and has been hosted, alongside all the
          material which has been used and crafted for the project, and deployed
          on Github thanks to Github Pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website serves as a display of the project&#39;s capabilities,
          demonstrating many different kinds of applications that the encoding
          methodology previously presented can accommodate. Other than hosting
          the present documentation and the page in which the different analyses
          are displayed, the webpage also offers a parallel visualization of the
          three texts, which can be explored scene by scene and compared
          simultaneously. This was achieved thanks to XML&#39;s querying
          capabilities through the use of XPath selectors, which fetch the
          portion of the texts corresponding to the scene selected by the user
          other than also fetching and displaying the corresponding screencaps
          from the movie, which are also uploaded and aligned in the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&#39;ve also developed a script using the
          <a href="https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/">moviepy</a> and
          <a href="https://pypi.org/project/imageio/ ">imageio</a> libraries to
          facilitate the extraction of frames from the movie scenes. The script
          is structured into several sequential steps for efficient processing.
          In the initial step, utilizing regex, we focus on creating and saving
          a CSV file. This CSV file contains all the subtitles sourced from the
          XML screenplay document, along with their respective dialog start and
          end timestamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving to the second step, we employ the ffmpeg_extract_subclip method
          from moviepy for processing the full-length MP4 video file and extract
          a clip of our choice. Users have the flexibility to extract a specific
          clip of interest by inputting the desired subtitle ID. After saving
          this chosen clip as a new MP4 file, we can apply the final step to
          that one only, significantly shortening the analysis time.The last
          step entails using imageio to capture and save frames from the
          selected clip in image format. Users also have the option to customize
          the number of frames to be extracted from the clip, as well as the
          temporal intervals between each frame.
        </p>

        <h2>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the project, we have had the opportunity to assess the
          challenges associated with XML markup, particularly in the context of
          film scripts. Additionally, during the data analysis phase, we have
          observed how changes in spatial settings, temporal elements, and
          character relationships have influenced the adaptation of the
          audiovisual content. The Metascript markup model is designed to serve
          as a versatile and open-source prototype. It can be easily adapted for
          use with other source materials, including screenplays and original
          novels, in future projects. Furthermore, the potential for textual
          comparison can be expanded by delving into the development of
          sentiment analysis and color analysis for film frames<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a></sup
          >. We aspire to incorporate these enhancements into the future
          evolution of Metascript.

              Metascript is an open source tool that provides a basic textual
              analysis framework for the comparison of an original text (novels,
              short stories, etc.) and its film transposition (screenplays). The
              goal of Metascript is to provide a set of guidelines for the
              markup and the metadata enrichment among multimodal texts, such as
              a book with its screenplay adaptation for audiovisual
              transposition.
