              young
              man, Jew, tall, rather broad, and none too thin. His long, blond, slightly curly hair
              had a
              touch of gray in it, and his moustache drooped in Polish fashion. He was wearing an
              open
              gray top-coat, underneath which were visible a greasy dress-suit, a crumpled shirt
              with
              three false diamond studs, a crinkled collar and a dangling, white silk tie. His
              eyelids
              were inflamed, as if from many sleepless nights, but his blue eyes gleamed brightly.

              He was a bald-headed, haggard man and wore an old-fashioned,
              flowered dressing-gown and a tasselled, Turkish cap which made him look like a foolish

            He

          well-informed about many affairs of his student days and internship. They had invited him
          into a box with great friendliness, but had left again with the promise that they would
          soon return without masks. When they did not appear, he became impatient and went down to
          the ball-room floor hoping to meet them again, but eagerly as he scanned the room, he
          could not see them anywhere. Instead, however, another woman unexpectedly took his arm. It
          was his <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina">
            wife
          </rs> . She had just freed herself from the company of a <rs

            stranger
          </rs> whose blase manner and apparently Polish accent had
          at first charmed her. Suddenly he had offended her--frightened her by a rather common and
          impertinent remark. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> and <rs ref="#Albertina">
            Albertina
          </rs> were glad to have escaped from a disappointingly
          commonplace masquerade prank, and soon sat like two lovers, among the other couples, in
          the buffet, eating oysters and drinking champagne. They chatted gaily, as though they had
          just made each other's acquaintance, acting a comedy of courting, bashful resistance,
          seduction and surrender. After driving home quickly through the snowy winter night, they
          sank into each other's arms and were more blissful in their ardent love than they had been
          for a long time. The gray of morning awakened them only too soon. Fridolin's profession
          summoned him to his patients at an early hour, while <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">
          Albertina</rs> would not stay in bed longer because of her duties as housewife and mother.
          So the ensuing hours passed, soberly and predetermined, in daily routine and work, and the
          events of the night before, both those at the beginning and at the end, had faded. </p>

        <p> But now that the day's work was done— the child had gone to bed and no disturbance was
          likely—the shadowy forms of the masquerade, the melancholy stranger and the red dominoes,
          rose again into reality. And all at once those insignificant events were imbued, magically
          and painfully, with the deceptive glow of neglected opportunities. Harmless but probing
          questions, and sly, ambiguous answers were exchanged. Neither failed to notice
          that the other was not absolutely honest, and so they became slightly vindictive. They
          exaggerated the degree of attraction that their unknown partners at the ball had exerted
          upon them while each made fun of the other's tendencies to jealousy and denied his own.
          Soon, their light conversation about the trifling matters of the night before changed into
          a more serious discussion of those hidden, scarcely suspected wishes, which can produce
          dangerous whirlpools even in the serenest and purest soul. They spoke of those mysterious
          regions of which they were hardly conscious but toward which the incomprehensible wind of
          fate might some day drive them, even if only in their dreams. For though they were united
          in thought and feeling, they knew that the preceding day had not been the first time that
          the spirit of adventure, freedom and danger had beckoned them. Uneasy, and tormenting
          themselves, each sought with disingenuous curiosity to draw out confessions from the
          other. Anxiously, they searched within themselves for some indifferent fact, or trifling
          experience, which might express the inexpressible, and the honest confession of which
          might relieve them of the strain and the suspicion which were becoming unbearable.

            Albertina

            Fridolin

          two other officers at an adjoining table. He had received a telegram during dinner,
          whereupon he had hastily said "good-bye" to his friends. </p>

            "as he was hurrying up the stairs in the hotel with
            his yellow hand-bag. He looked at me as he passed, but didn't stop until he had gone a
          few more steps.
            Then he turned and our eyes met. He didn't smile; in fact, it seemed to me that he
          scowled. I suppose I
            did the same, for I was very much stirred. That whole day I lay on the beach, lost in
          dreams. Had he
            called me—I thought—I could not have resisted. I thought I was ready for anything. I had
          practically
            resolved to give up you, the child, my future, and at the same time —if you can
          understand it?—you
            were dearer to me than ever. That same afternoon—surely you remember—we discussed many
          things
            very intimately, among others our common future, and our child. At sunset you and I were
          sitting on the
            balcony, when, down below on the beach, he passed without looking up. I was extremely
          thrilled to see
            him, but I stroked your forehead and kissed your hair, and my love for you was both
          sorrowful and
            compassionate. That evening at dinner I wore a white rose and you yourself said I was
          very beautiful.
            Perhaps it wasn't mere chance that the stranger and his friends sat near us. He didn't
          look at me, but I
            considered getting up, walking over to him and saying: Here I am, my beloved for whom I
          have waited —
            take me. At that moment the telegram was handed to him. He read it, turned pale,
          whispered a few
            words to the younger of the two officers—and glancing at me mysteriously he left the
          room."

            "You're right."
          </said> He was standing at the window, his face in
          shadow and in a hoarse and slightly hostile voice he began: <said aloud="true"
            direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina"> In the morning, sometimes very early before you got
          up, I used to stroll along the beach, out beyond the town. Even at that hour the sun was
          always shining over the sea, bright and strong. Out there on the beach, as you know, were
          cottages, each one standing like a world in itself. Some had fenced-in gardens, others
          were surrounded only by the woods. The bathing-huts were separated from the cottages by
          the road and part of the beach. I hardly ever met people at such an early hour, and
          bathers were never out. One morning, quite suddenly, I noticed the figure of a woman. She
          had suddenly appeared on the narrow ledge of a bathing-hut, which rested on piles driven
          into the sand. She was cautiously advancing, placing one foot before the other, her arms
          extended backward against the wooden boards. She was quite a <rs ref="#younggirl">
              young girl
            </rs> , possibly fifteen years old, with loose
          blond hair hanging over her shoulders and on one side over her delicate breast. She was
          looking down into the water and was slowly moving along the wall, her gaze lowered in the
          direction of the far corner. All at once she stopped opposite me and reached far back with
          her arms as though trying to secure a firmer hold. Looking up, she suddenly saw me. A
          tremor passed through her body, as though she wished to drop into the water or run. But as
          she could move only very slowly on the narrow ledge, she had to stay where she was. She
          stood there with a face expressing at first fright, then anger, and finally embarrassment.
          All at once, however, she smiled, smiled marvelously. Her eyes welcomed me, beckoned to
          me, and at the same time slightly mocked me, as she glanced at the strip of water between
          us. Then she stretched her young and slender body, glad of her beauty, and proudly and
          sweetly stirred by my obvious admiration. We stood facing each other for perhaps ten
          seconds, with half-open lips and dazzled eyes. Involuntarily I stretched out my arms to
          her; her eyes expressed surrender and joy. Then she shook her head vigorously, took one
          arm from the wall and commanded me with a gesture to go away. When I didn't at once obey,
          her childlike eyes turned on me such a beseeching look that there was nothing for me to do
          but to go, and I went as quickly as possible. I did not look back once—not because I felt
          considerate, obedient or chivalrous, but because in her last glance I sensed an emotion so
          intense, so far beyond anything I had ever experienced, that I was not far from fainting." </said>
          And he stopped. </p>
        <p> With her eyes cast down and in a monotonous voice, <rs ref="#Albertina">

        <p>
          She took his hands and looked up at him with misty eyes, in the depths of which he could
          read her thoughts. She was thinking of his other and more real experiences, those of his
          young manhood, many of which she knew about. When they were first married he had yielded,
          all too readily, to her jealous curiosity and had told her (indeed it often seemed to him)
          had surrendered to her many secrets which he should rather have kept to himself. He knew
          that she was inevitably reminded of these affairs and he was hardly surprised when she
          murmured the half-forgotten name of one of his early sweethearts. It sounded to him a
          little like a reproach, or was it a covert threat?
        </p>
        <p> He raised her hands to his lips. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"

        <p> WHEN <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> reached the street, he unbuttoned his coat. It had
          suddenly begun to thaw; the snow on the sidewalk was almost gone, and there was a touch of
          spring in the air. It was less than a quarter of an hour's walk to Schreyvogel Strasse
          from his home near the General Hospital, and he soon reached the old house. He walked up
          the dimly lighted winding staircase to the second floor and pulled the bell-rope. But
          before the old-fashioned bell was heard, he noticed that the door was ajar, and entering
          through the unlighted foyer into the living room he saw at once that he had come too late.
          The green-shaded kerosene lamp which was hanging from the low ceiling cast a dim light on
          the bedspread under which a lean body lay motionless. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> knew the old man so well that he seemed to see the
          face plainly, although it was outside the circle of light— the high forehead, the thin and
          lined cheeks, the snow-white beard and also the strikingly ugly ears with coarse, white
          hairs. At the foot of the bed sat <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> , the Councilor's daughter, completely exhausted,
          her arms hanging limply from her shoulders. An odor of old furniture, medicine, petroleum
          and cooking pervaded the room, and in addition to that there was a trace of eau de Cologne
          and scented soap. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> also noticed the indefinite, sweetish scent of this
          pale girl who was still young and who had been slowly fading for months and years under
          the stress of severe household duties, nursing and night watches. When the doctor entered
          she looked up, but because of the dim light he could not see whether she had blushed, as
          usual, when he appeared. She started to rise, but he stopped her with a movement of his
          hand, and so she merely greeted him with a nod, her eyes large and sad. He stepped to the
          head of the bed and mechanically placed his hands on the forehead of the dead man and on
          the arms which were lying on the bed-spread in loose and open shirt sleeves. His shoulders
          drooped with a slight expression of regret. He stuck his hands into the pockets of his
          coat and his eyes wandered about the room until they finally rested on <rs ref="#Marianne">
          Marianne
          </rs> . Her hair was blond and thick, but dry; her neck
          well-formed and slender, although a little wrinkled and rather yellow; and her lips were
          thin and firmly pressed together. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne"> Well, my dear <rs ref="#Marianne">
              Marianne
            </rs> ," </said> he said in a slightly embarrassed
          whisper, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">
            "you weren't entirely
            unprepared for
            this."
          </said>
          She held out her hand to him. He took it sympathetically and inquired about the
          particulars of the final, fatal attack. <said aloud="true" direct="false" who="Marianne"
            listener="Fridolin"> She reported briefly and to the point, and then spoke of her
          father's last comparatively easy days, during which <rs ref="#Fridolin">
              Fridolin
            </rs> had not seen him. </said> Drawing up a chair,
          he sat down opposite her, and tried to console her by <said aloud="true" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne">
            saying that her father must have suffered very little at the last.
            He then
            asked if any of her relatives had been notified.
          </said>
					<said
            aloud="true" direct="false" who="Marianne" listener="Fridolin">
            Yes, she said, the housekeeper had
            already gone to tell her uncle, and very likely Doctor Roediger would soon appear.
          </said>
					<said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Marianne" listener="Fridolin">
            "My
            fiance,"
          </said> she added, and did not look him
          straight in the eye. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> simply nodded. During the year he had met <rs
            ref="#Roediger">
            Doctor
            Roediger
          </rs> two or three times in the
          Councilor's house. The pale young man—an instructor in History at the University of
          Vienna—was of an unusually slender build with a short, blond beard and spectacles, and had
          made quite a good impression upon him, without, however, arousing his interest beyond
          that. <rs
            ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> would certainly look better, he thought to himself,
          if she were his mistress. Her hair would be less dry, her lips would be fuller and redder. <said
            aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            I wonder how
            old she is, he reflected. The first time I attended the Councilor, three or four years
          ago, she was twentv-three. At that time her mother was still living and she was more
          cheerful than now. She even took singing lessons for a while. So she is going to marry
            this instructor! I wonder why? She surely isn't in love with him, and he isn't likely to
          have much money either. What kind of a marriage will it turn out to be? Probably like a
          thousand others. But it's none of my business. It's quite possible that I shall never see
          her again, since there's nothing more for me to do here. Well, many others that I cared
            for have gone the same way.
          </said>
          As these thoughts passed through his mind, <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> began to speak of her father—with fervor—as if his
          death had suddenly made him a more remarkable person. <said aloud="false" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            Then he was really only fifty-four years old? Well, of course, he had had
            so many worries and disappointments—his wife always ill—and his son such a grief! What,
          she had a brother? Certainly, she had once told the doctor about him.
          </said>
          Her brother was now living somewhere abroad. A picture that he had painted when he was
          fifteen was hanging over there in <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> 's room. It represented an officer galloping down a
          hill. Her father had always pretended not to see it although it wasn't bad. Oh yes, if
          he'd had a chance her brother might have made something of himself. <said aloud="false"
            direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            How
            excitedly she speaks
          </said> , <rs ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin
          </rs> thought, <said aloud="false" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            and how bright her eyes are! Is it fever? Quite possibly. She's
            grown much thinner. Probably has tuberculosis.
          </said>
          She kept up her stream of talk, but it seemed to him that she didn't quite know what she
          was saying. It was twelve years since her brother had left home. In fact, she had been a
          child when he disappeared. They had last heard from him four or five years ago, at
          Christmas, from a small city in Italy. Strange to say, she had forgotten the name. She
          continued like this for a while, almost incoherently. Suddenly she stopped and sat there
          silently, her head resting in her hands. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> was tired and even more bored. He was anxiously
          waiting for some one to come, her relatives, or her fiance. The silence in the room was
          oppressive. It seemed to him that the dead man joined in the silence, deliberately and
          with malicious joy. With a side glance at the corpse, he said: <said aloud="true"
            direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne"> At any rate, Fraulein <rs ref="#Marianne">
              Marianne
            </rs> , as things are now, it is fortunate that you
          won't have to stay in this house very much longer." </said> And when she raised her head a
          little, without, however, looking at <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> , he continued: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne">
            "I suppose your fiance will soon get a
            professorship. The chances for promotion are more favorable in the Faculty of Philosophy
          than with us in Medicine."
          </said>
          He was thinking that, years ago, he also had aspired to an academic career, but because he
          wanted a comfortable income, he had finally decided to practice medicine. Suddenly he felt
          that compared with this noble <rs ref="#Roediger">
            Doctor

					<rs ref="#Marianne">

          </said> said <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> , and was about to congratulate her but it seemed
          rather out of place at the moment. He glanced at the closed window, and without asking for
          permission but availing himself of his privilege as a doctor, he opened both casements and
          let some air in. It had become even warmer and more spring-like, and the breeze seemed to
          bring with it a slight fragrance of the distant awakening woods. When he turned back into
          the room, he saw <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> 's eyes fixed upon him with a questioning look. He
          moved nearer to her and said: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne">
            "I hope the fresh air will be good for you. It has become quite
            warm, and last night"
          </said>
          —he was about to say: we drove home from the masquerade in a snowstorm, but he quickly
          changed the sentence and continued: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne">
            "Last night the snow was
            still lying on the streets a foot and a half deep."
          </said>
          She hardly heard what he said. Her eyes became moist, large tears streamed down her cheeks
          and again she buried her face in her hands. In spite of himself, he placed his hand on her
          head, caressing it. He could feel her body beginning to tremble, and her sobs which were
          at first very quiet, gradually became louder and finally quite unrestrained. All at once
          she slipped down from her chair and lay at <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> 's feet, clasping his knees with her arms and
          pressing her face against them. Then she looked up to him with large eyes, wild with
          grief, and whispered ardently: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Marianne"
            listener="Fridolin">
            "I don't want to leave here. Even if you never return, if I
            am never to see you again, I want, at least, to live near you."
          </said>
          He was touched rather than surprised, for he had always known that she either was, or
          imagined herself to be, in love with him. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne"> "Please—get up, <rs ref="#Marianne">
              Marianne
            </rs> ," </said> he said softly and bending down he
          gently raised her. Of course, she is hysterical, he remarked to himself and he glanced at
          her dead father. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            I wonder if he hears
            everything
          </said> , he thought.
          Perhaps he isn't really dead. Perhaps everyone in the first hours after passing away, is
          only in a coma. He put his arms about her in a very hesitating embrace, and almost against
          his will he kissed her on the forehead, an act that somehow seemed rather ridiculous. He
          had a fleeting recollection of reading a novel years ago in which a young man, still
          almost a boy, had been seduced, in fact, practically raped, by the friend of his mother at
          the latter's deathbed. At the same time he thought of his wife, without knowing why, and
          he was conscious of some bitterness and a vague animosity against the man with the yellow
          hand-bag on the hotel stairs in Denmark. He held <rs ref="#Marianne">

          </rs> closer, but without the slightest emotion. The sight
          of her lustreless, dry hair, the indefinite, sweetish scent of her unaired dress gave him
          a slight feeling of revulsion. The bell outside rang again, and feeling he was released,
          he hastily kissed <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> 's hand, as if in gratitude, and went to open the
          door. <rs

            Doctor
            Roediger
          </rs> stood there, in a dark gray
          top-coat, an umbrella in his hand and a serious face, appropriate to the occasion. The two
          men greeted each other much more cordially than was called for by their actual state of
          acquaintance. Then they stepped into the room. After an embarrassed look at the deceased, <rs
            ref="#Roediger">
            Roediger

            Fridolin

          official death certificate. He turned up the gas-light over the desk and his eyes fell
          upon the picture of the whiteuniformed officer, galloping down hill, with drawn sabre, to
          meet an invisible enemy. It hung in a narrow frame of dull gold and rather resembled a
          modest chromo-lithograph. With his death-certificate filled out, <rs ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin
          </rs> returned to the room where the engaged couple sat,
          hand in hand, by the bed of the dead Councilor. Again the door-bell rang and Doctor
          Roediger rose to answer it. While he was gone, <rs ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> , with her eyes on the floor, said, almost
          inaudibly: <said

          died. The little room suddenly seemed crowded with mourners. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin

        <p> WHEN <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> stood on the street in front of the house, he looked
          up at the window which he himself had opened a little while before. The casements were
          swaying slightly in the wind of early spring, and the people who remained behind them up
          there, the living as well as the dead, all seemed unreal and phantomlike. He felt as if he
          had escaped from something, not so much from an adventure, but rather from a melancholy
          spell the power of which he was trying to break. He felt strangely disinclined to go home.
          The snow in the streets had melted, except where little heaps of dirty white had been
          piled up on either side of the curb. The gas-flame in the street lamps flickered and a
          nearby church bell struck eleven. <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> decided that before going to bed, he would spend a
          half hour in a quiet nook of a cafe near his residence. As he walked through Rathaus Park
          he noticed here and there on benches standing in the shadow, that couples were sitting,
          clasped together, just as if Spring had actually arrived and no danger were lurking in the
          deceptive, warm air. A tramp in tattered clothes was lying full length on a bench with his
          hat over his face. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            Suppose I wake him and give him some money
            for a night's lodging
          </said>
          , <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> thought. <said aloud="false" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            But what good would that do? Then I would
            have to provide for the
            next night, too, or there'd be no sense in it, and in the end I might be suspected of
          having criminal relations with him.
          </said>
          He quickened his steps to escape as rapidly as possible from all responsibility and
          temptation. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            And why only this one?
          </said> he asked himself. There are
          thousands of such poor devils in Vienna alone. It's manifestly impossible to help all of
          them or to worry about all the poor wretches! He was reminded of the dead man he had just
          left, and shuddered; in fact, he felt slightly nauseated at the thought that decay and
          decomposition, according to eternal laws, had already begun their work in the lean body
          under the brown flannel blanket. He was glad that he was still alive, and in all
          probability these ugly things were still far removed from him. He was, in fact, still in
          the prime of youth, he had a charming and lovable wife and could have several women in
          addition, if he happened to want them, although, to be sure, such affairs required more
          leisure than was his. He then remembered that he would have to be in his ward at the
          hospital at eight in the morning, visit his private patients from eleven to one, keep
          office hours from three to five, and that even in the evening he had several appointments
          to visit patients. Well, he hoped that it would be some time before he would again be
          called out so late at night. As he crossed Rathaus Square, which had a dull gleam like a
          brownish pond, and turned homeward, he heard the muffled sound of marching steps in the
          distance. Then he saw, still quite far away, a small group of fraternity students, six or
          eight in number, turning a corner and coming towards him. When the light of a street lamp
          fell upon them he thought he recognized them, with their blue caps, as members of the
          Alemannia, for although he had never belonged to a fraternity, he had fought a few sabre
          duels in his time. In thinking of his student days he was reminded again of the <rs
            ref="#TWOW">
            red
            dominoes
          </rs> who had lured him into a box at the
          ball the night before and then had so shamefully deserted him. The students were quite
          near now; they were laughing and talking loudly. Perhaps one or two of them were from the
          hospital? But it was impossible to see their faces plainly because of the dim light, and
          he had to stay quite close to the houses so as not to collide with them. Now they had
          passed. Only the one in the rear, a tall fellow with open overcoat and a bandage over his
          left eye, seemed to lag behind, and deliberately bumped into him with his raised elbow. It
          couldn't have been mere chance. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            What's got into that fellow?
          </said>
					<rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> thought, and involuntarily he stopped. The other
          took two more steps and turned. They looked at each other for a moment with only a short
          distance separating them. Suddenly <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> turned around again and went on. He heard a short
          laugh behind him and he longed to challenge the fellow, but he felt his heart beating
          strangely, just as it had on a previous occasion, twelve or fourteen years before. There
          had been an unusually loud knock on his door while he had had with him a certain charming
          young creature who was never tired of prattling about her jealous fiance. As a matter of
          fact, it was only the postman who had knocked in such a threatening manner. And now he
          felt his heart beating just as it had at that time. <said aloud="false" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            What's the meaning of this?
          </said> he asked himself, and he
          noticed that his knees were shaking a little. <said aloud="false" direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            Am I a coward? Oh! nonsense
          </said> , he reassured himself. <said
            aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            Why should I go and face a drunken student,
            I, a man of thirty-five, a practising
            physician, a married man and father of a child? Formal challenge! Seconds! A duel! And
          perhaps because of such a silly encounter receive a cut in my arm and be unable to perform
          my professional duties?—Or lose an eye?—Or even get blood-poisoning?—And in a week perhaps
          be in the same position as the man in Schreyvogel Strasse under the brown flannel blanket?
          Coward—?
          </said>
          He had fought three sabre duels, and had even been ready to fight a duel with pistols, and
          it wasn't at his request that the matter had been called off. And what about his
          profession! There were dangers lurking everywhere and at all times—except that one usually
          forgets about them. Why, how long ago was it that that child with diphtheria had coughed
          in his face? Only three or four days, that's all. After all, that was much more dangerous
          than a little fencing match with sabres, and he hadn't given it a second thought. Well, if
          he ever met that fellow again, the affair could still be straightened out. He was by no
          means bound by the code of honor to take a silly encounter with a student seriously when
          on an errand of mercy, to or from a patient. But if, for instance, he should meet the
          young Dane with whom <rs ref="#Albertina">
            Albertina
          </rs> — oh, nonsense, what was he thinking of? Well,
          after all, it was just as bad as if she had been his mistress. Even worse. Yes, just let
          that fellow cross his path! What a joy it would be to face him somewhere in a clearing in
          the woods and aim a pistol at his forehead with its smoothly combed blond hair. He
          suddenly discovered that he had passed his destination. He was in a narrow street in which
          only a few doubtful-looking women were strolling about in a pitiful attempt to bag their
          game. <said
            aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            It's phantomlike
          </said> , he thought. And in retrospect the
          students, too, with their blue caps, suddenly seemed unreal. The same was true of <rs
            ref="#Marianne">
            Marianne
          </rs> , her fiance, her uncle and aunt, all of whom he
          pictured standing hand in hand around the deathbed of the old <rs ref="councilor">
          Councilor
          </rs> . <rs ref="#Albertina">
            Albertina
          </rs> , too, whom he could see in his mind's eye soundly
          sleeping, her arms folded under her head—even his child lying in the narrow white brass
          bed, rolled up in a heap, and the red-cheeked governess with the mole on her left
          temple—all of them seemed to belong to another world. Although this idea made him shudder
          a bit, it also reassured him, for it seemed to free him from all responsibility, and to
          loosen all the bonds of human relationship. <rs ref="#Mizzi">
            One of the girls
          </rs> wandering about stopped him. She was still a
          young and pretty little thing, very pale with red-painted lips. <said aloud="false"
            direct="false"
            who="Fridolin">
            She also

            Is this cowardice too? I
            suppose really it is

          He heard her steps and then her voice behind him. <said aloud="true" direct="true"

            listener="Fridolin">
            Won't you come

          around involuntarily. <said

            "How do you know who I am?"

          He had had no relations with a woman of this sort since he had been a student at the
          Gymnasium. Was the attraction this girl had for him a sign that he was suddenly reverting
          to adolescence? He recalled a casual acquaintance, a smart young man, who was supposed to
          be extremely successful with women. Once while <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> was a student he had been sitting with him in an
          all-night cafe, after a ball. When the young man proposed to leave with one of the regular
          girls of the place, <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> looked at him in surprise. Thereupon he answered: <said

            "After
            all, it's the most convenient way— and they aren't by any means the worst." "What's your
          name?"
          </said>
					<rs
            ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> asked the girl. <said aloud="true" direct="true"

            listener="Fridolin">
            "Well, what do you think?
            Mizzi,
            of course."
          </said>
          She unlocked the house-door, stepped into the hallway and waited for <rs ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin
          </rs> to follow her. <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Mizzi"
            listener="Fridolin">
            "Come on,"
          </said> she said when he hesitated. He stepped in beside
          her, the door closed behind him, she locked it, lit a wax candle and went ahead, lighting
          the way. <said
            aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
            —Am I mad?
          </said> he asked himself. Of course I shall have nothing
          to do with her. An oil-lamp was burning in her room, and she turned it up. It was a fairly
          pleasant place and neatly kept. At any rate, it smelled fresher than <rs ref="#Marianne">
          Marianne
          </rs> 's home, for instance. But then, of course, no old man
          had been lying ill there for months. <rs ref="#Mizzi">
            The girl
          </rs> smiled, and without forwardness approached <rs
            ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> who gently kept her at a distance. She pointed to a

            listener="Fridolin">
            "You must be very tired,"

          </said>
          He noticed that her lips were not painted, as he had thought, but were a natural red, and

            Who in the world would suspect that I'm

          </said>
          Her lips were seeking his, but he drew back his head. She looked at him with sad surprise
          and slipped down from his lap. He was sorry, for he had felt much comforting tenderness in
          her embrace. She took a red dressing-gown which was hanging over the foot of the open bed,
          slipped into it and folded her arms over her breast so that her entire body was concealed. <said

          answer. <said

            a nice gentle voice. Just talk to me."

          She sat down on the couch and shook her head. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Mizzi"

            "It's too bad."
          </said> These last words made the blood race
          through his veins. He walked over to her, longing to touch her, and declared that he
          trusted her implicitly and saying so he spoke the truth. He put his arms around her and
          wooed her like a sweetheart, like a beloved woman, but she resisted, until he felt ashamed
          and finally gave it up. She explained: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Mizzi"

          </said>
          She was so positive in refusing the banknotes which he offered her that he did not insist.
          She put a little blue woolen shawl about her shoulders, lit a candle to light him

          through the dark streets, letting the breeze blow through his hair. Finally, he turned
          resolutely into a third-rate coffee-house. The place was dimly lighted and not especially
          large, but it had an old-fashioned, cozy air about it, and was almost empty at this late
          hour. Three men were playing cards in a corner. The waiter who had been watching them
          helped <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin

            Fridolin

          the papers. His eyes were arrested here and there by some news-item. In some Bohemian
          city, street signs with German names had been torn down. There was a conference in
          Constantinople in which Lord Cranford took part about constructing a railway in Asia
          Minor. The firm Benies &amp; Weingruber had gone into bankruptcy. The prostitute Anna
          Tiger, in a fit of jealousy, had attempted to throw vitriol on her friend, Hermine
          Drobizky. An Ash Wednesday fishdinner was being given that evening in Sophia Hall. Marie
          B., a young girl residing at No. 28 Schonbrunn Strasse, had poisoned herself with mercuric
          chloride.—Prosaically commonplace as they were, all these facts, the insignificant as well
          as the sad, had a sobering and reassuring effect on <rs ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin

          stupid to take mercuric chloride! At this very moment, while he was sitting snugly in the
          cafe, while <rs

          young man, tall, rather broad, and none too thin. His long, blond, slightly curly hair had
          a touch of gray in it, and his moustache drooped in Polish fashion. He was wearing an open
          gray top-coat, underneath which were visible a greasy dress-suit, a crumpled shirt with
          three false diamond studs, a crinkled collar and a dangling, white silk tie. His eyelids

          Suddenly it occurred to him that someone had been playing the piano when he entered; in

            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Nachtigall">
            "Are you devoting
            yourself entirely to it?"
          </said> he
          asked. He remembered that <rs ref="#Nachtigall">
            Nachtigall
          </rs> had definitely given up the study of medicine
          after his second preliminary examination in zoology, which he had passed although he was
          seven years late in taking it. Since then he had been hanging around the hospital, the
          dissecting room, the laboratories and classrooms for some time afterwards. With his blond
          artist's head, his crinkled collar, his dangling tie that had once been white, he had been
          a striking and, in the humorous sense, popular figure. He had been much liked, not only by
          his fellow-students, but also by many professors. The son of a Jewish gin-shop owner in a
          small Polish town, he had left home early and had come to Vienna to study medicine. The
          trifling sums he received from his parents had from the very-beginning been scarcely worth
          mention and were soon discontinued. However, this didn't prevent his appearing in the
          Riedhof Hotel at the table reserved for medical students where <rs ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin
          </rs> was a regular guest. At intervals, one after another
          of his more well-todo fellow-students would pay his bill. He sometimes, also, was given
          clothes, which he accepted gladly and without false pride. He had already learned to play
          in his home town from a pianist stranded there, and while he was a medical student in
          Vienna he had studied at the Conservatory where he was considered a talented musician of
          great promise. But here, too, he was neither serious nor diligent enough to develop his
          art systematically. He soon became entirely content with the impression he made on his
          acquaintances, or rather with the pleasure he gave them by his playing. For a while he had
          a position as pianist in a suburban dancing-school. Fellow-students and table-companions
          tried to introduce him into fashionable houses in the same capacity, but on such occasions
          he would play only what suited him and as long as he chose. His conversations with the
          young girls present were not always harmless, and he drank more than he could carry. Once,
          playing for a dance in the house of a wealthy banker, he embarrassed several couples with
          flattering but improper remarks, and ended up by playing a wild cancan and singing a
          risque song with his powerful, bass voice. The host gave him a severe calling down, but <rs
            ref="#Nachtigall">
            Nachtigall
          </rs> , blissfully hilarious, got up and embraced him.
          The latter was furious and, although himself a Jew, hurled a common insult at him. <rs
            ref="#Nachtigall">
            Nachtigall
          </rs> at once retaliated with a powerful box on his
          ears, and this definitely concluded his career in the fashionable houses of the city. He
          behaved better, on the whole, in more intimate circles, although sometimes when the hour
          was late, he had to be put out of the place by force. But the following morning all was
          forgiven and forgotten. One day, long after his friends had graduated, he disappeared from
          the city without a word. For a few months he sent post cards from various Russian and
          Polish cities, and once <rs
            ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin
          </rs> , who was one of <rs ref="#Nachtigall">
            Nachtigall
          </rs> 's favorites, was reminded of his existence not
          only by a card, but by a request for a moderate sum of money, without explanation. <rs
            ref="#Fridolin">
            Fridolin

            Nachtigall

          quarter to one in the morning, <rs ref="#Nachtigall">
            Nachtigall
          </rs> insisted on paying his debt, and took the exact

          filled, <rs

            Then he talked in very general terms of his duties at the hospital and his private

          children, all of them living in Lemberg, and all by one and the same woman. He had been
          back in Vienna since the preceding fall. The vaudeville company he had been with had
          suddenly gone to pieces. He was now playing anywhere and everywhere, anything that
          happened to come along, sometimes in two or three different houses the same night. For
          example, down there in that basement—not at all a fashionable place, as he remarked,

          darkness. A number of little electric bulbs suddenly shone between the open cabinets of a
          long, narrow passage, the end of which was enveloped in darkness. There were all kinds of
          costumes hanging to the right and to the left. On one side knights, squires, peasants,
          hunters, scholars, Orientals and clowns; on the other, ladies-at-court, baronesses,
          peasant women, lady's maids, queens of the night. The corresponding head-dresses were on a

            Fridolin

          any of his misgivings. Now that I've gone this far, he thought, <said aloud="false"

          shook his head negatively without turning around. The voice behind him whispered: <said

            "I

          room; the organ had a new sound which was anything but sacred. It was worldly, voluptuous,
          and pealing. Looking around <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin

          the monks were left. The voice had meanwhile also changed. It rose by way of an
          artistically executed trill from its low and serious pitch to a high and jubilant tone. In
          place of the organ a piano had suddenly chimed in with its worldly and brazen tunes. <rs

          blaze of light. All the women were standing there motionless. They wore dark veils over
          their heads, faces and necks and black masks over their eyes, but otherwise they were
          completely naked. <rs

            Fridolin

          bodies, from delicate figures to those luxuriously developed. He realized that each of
          these women would forever be a mystery, and that the enigma of their large eyes peering at
          him from beneath the black masks would remain unsolved. The delight of beholding was
          changed to an almost unbearable agony of desire. And the others seemed to experience a
          similar sensation. The first gasps of rapture had changed to sighs that held a note very
          near anguish. A cry broke out somewhere. Suddenly all of them, as though pursued, rushed
          from the darkened room to the women, who received them with wild and wicked laughter. The
          men were no longer in cassocks, but dressed as cavaliers, in white, yellow, blue and red. <rs

          to the test. In spite of it he meant to dance with her, but at that moment another woman
          left her partner and walked quickly up to him. He knew at once that it was the same one
          who had already warned him. She pretended that she had just seen him and whispered, in a

          voluptuous mysteries that surrounded him—he was intoxicated, his thirst unsatisfied, with
          all the experiences of the night, none of which had come to a satisfactory conclusion. He
          was intoxicated with himself, with his boldness, the change he felt in himself, and he
          touched the veil which was wound about her head, as though he intended to remove it. She
          seized his hands. <said

            wedding?"
          </said>
          He remembered the incident, even the name, and mentioned it. <said aloud="true"

          She nodded. One of the cavaliers, the most distinguished looking of them all and the only
          one dressed in white, suddenly stopped before them. With a slight bow, courteous but
          imperative, he asked the woman with whom <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> was talking to dance with him. She seemed to
          hesitate a moment, but he put his arm around her waist and they drifted away to join the
          other couples in the adjoining room. A sudden feeling of solitude made <rs ref="#Fridolin"
            type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> shiver as if with cold. He looked about him. Nobody
          seemed to be paying any attention to him. This was perhaps his last chance to leave with
          impunity. He didn't know, however, why it was that he remained spell-bound in his corner
          where he now felt sure that he was not observed. It might be his aversion to an inglorious
          and perhaps ridiculous retreat, or the excruciating ungratified desire for the beautiful
          woman whose fragrance was still in his nostrils. Or he may have stayed because he vaguely
          hoped that all that had happened so far was intended as a test of his courage and that
          this magnificent woman would be his reward. It was clear at any rate that the strain was
          too great to be endured, and that, no matter what the danger, he would have to end it. It
          could hardly cost him his life, no matter what he decided. He might be among fools, or
          libertines, but certainly not among rascals or criminals. The thought occurred to him to
          acknowledge himself as an intruder and to place himself at their disposal in chivalrous
          fashion. This night could only conclude in such a manner,—with a harmonious finale, as it
          were—if it were to mean more than a wild, shadow-like succession of gloomy and lascivious
          adventures, all without an end. So, taking a deep breath, he prepared to carry out his
          plan. At this moment, however, a voice whispered beside him: <said aloud="true"

            "Here I am, take me—all of you!"
          </said> The dark costume dropped
          from her, as if by magic. She stood there in the radiance of her white body; reached for
          the veil which was wrapped about her head, face and neck and unwound it with a wonderful
          circular motion. It sank to the floor, dark hair fell in great profusion over her
          shoulders, breasts and hips—but before <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> could even glance at her face, he was seized by
          irresistible arms, and pushed to the door. A moment later he found himself in the
          anteroom, the door closed behind him. A masked servant brought him his fur coat and helped
          him put it on. The main door opened automatically, and as if driven by some invisible
          force, he hurried out. As he stood on the street the light behind disappeared. The house
          stood there in silence with closed windows from which not a glimmer issued. I must
          remember everything clearly, was his main thought; I must find the house again—the rest
          will follow as a matter of course. Darkness surrounded him. The dull reddish glow of a
          street lamp was visible a slight distance above where the cab was to wait for him. The
          mourning-coach drove up from the street below, as though he had called it. A servant
          opened the door. </p>

          </said>
          The man replied with a wave of his hand which was anything but servant-like, so that
          objection was out of the question. The ridiculously high silk hat of the coachman towered
          up into the night. The wind was blowing a gale; violet clouds raced across the sky. <rs
            ref="#Fridolin"
            type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> felt that, after his previous experience, there was
          nothing for him to do but to get into the carriage. It started the moment he was inside.
          He resolved, as soon as possible, to clear up the mystery of his adventure, no matter how
          dangerous it might be. His life, it seemed, would not have the slightest meaning any more,
          if he did not succeed in finding the incomprehensible <rs ref="woman" type="character">
          woman
          </rs> who at this very moment was paying for his safety. It was
          only too easy to guess the price. But why should she sacrifice herself for him? To
          sacrifice—? Was she the kind of woman to whom the things that were facing her, that she
          was now submitting to, could mean a sacrifice? If she attended these affairs—and since she
          seemed to understand the rules so well it could not be her first time—what difference
          could it make to her if she belonged to one of the cavaliers, or to all? Indeed, could she
          possibly be anything but a woman of easy virtue? Were any of them anything else? That's
          what they were, without a doubt, even if all of them led another, more normal life, so to
          speak, besides this one of promiscuity. Perhaps everything he had just gone through had
          been only an outrageous joke. A joke planned, prepared and even rehearsed for such an
          occasion when some bold outsider should be caught intruding? And yet, as he thought of the <rs
            ref="woman" type="character">
            woman
          </rs> who had warned him from the very beginning, who was now
          ready to pay for him—he remembered something in her voice, her bearing, in the royal
          nobility of her nude body which could not possibly have been false. Or was it possible
          that only his sudden appearance had caused her to change? After everything that had
          happened, such a supposition did not seem impossible. There was no conceit in this idea.
          There may be hours or nights, he thought, in which some strange, irresistible charm
          emanates from men who under normal circumstances have no special power over the other sex.
          The carriage continued up-hill. If all were well, he should have turned into the main
          street long ago. What were they going to do with him? Where was the carriage taking him?
          Was the comedy to be continued elsewhere? And what would the continuation be? A solution
          of the mystery and a happy reunion at some other place. Would he be rewarded for passing
          the test so creditably and made a member of the secret society? Was he to have
          unchallenged possession of the lovely nun? </p>
        <p> The windows of the carriage were closed and <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
          Fridolin
          </rs> tried to look out—but they were opaque. He attempted
          to open them, first on one side, then on the other, but it was impossible. The glass
          partition between him and the coachman's box was just as thick and just as firmly closed.
          He knocked on the glass, he called, he shouted, but the carriage went on. He tried to open
          both the doors, but they wouldn't budge. His renewed calling was drowned by the rattling
          of the wheels and the roaring of the wind. The carriage began to jolt, going down-hill,
          faster and faster. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> , uneasy and alarmed, was on the point of smashing
          one of the blind windows, when the carriage suddenly stopped. Both doors opened together,
          as if by some mechanism, and as though <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> had been ironically given the choice between one
          side or the other. He jumped out, the doors closed with a bang—and without the coachman
          paying the slightest attention to him, the carriage drove away across the open field into
          the darkness of the night. The sky was overcast, clouds raced across it, and the wind
          whistled. <rs
            ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> stood in the snow which shed a faint light round
          about. He was alone, his open fur coat over his monk's costume, the pilgrim's hat on his
          head; and an uncanny feeling overcame him. The main street was a slight distance away,
          where a row of dimly-flickering street lamps indicated the direction of the city. However,
          he ran straight down across the sloping, snow-covered field, which shortened the way, so
          as to get among people as quickly as possible. His feet soaked, he came into a narrow,
          almost unlighted street, and at first walked along between high board fences which groaned
          in the wind. Turning the next corner, he reached a somewhat wider street, where scattered
          little houses alternated with empty building lots. Somewhere a tower clock struck three. </p>
        <p> Someone was coming towards him. The person wore a short jacket, he had his hands in his
          trouser pockets, his head was down between his shoulders, and his hat was pulled over his
          forehead. <rs
            ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> got ready for an attack, but the tramp unexpectedly
          turned and ran. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin" listener="Fridolin">
            What does that mean?
          </said> he asked himself. Then he decided that
          he must present a very uncanny appearance, took off the pilgrim's hat and buttoned his
          coat, underneath which the monk's gown was flapping around his ankles. Again he turned a
          corner into a suburban main street. A man in peasant's dress walked past and spoke to him,
          thinking him a priest. The light of a street lamp fell upon a sign on a corner house.
          Liebhartstal—then he wasn't very far from the house which he had left less than an hour
          before. For a second he felt tempted to retrace his steps and to wait in the vicinity for
          further developments. But he gave up the idea when he realized that he would only expose
          himself to grave danger without solving the mystery. As he imagined what was probably
          taking place in the villa at this very moment he was filled with wrath, despair, shame and
          fear. This state of mind was so unbearable that it almost made him sorry the tramp had not
          attacked him; in fact, he almost regretted that he wasn't lying against the fence in the
          deserted street with a knife-gash in his side. That, at least, might have given some
          significance to this senseless night with its childish adventures, all of which had been
          so ruthlessly cut short. It seemed positively ridiculous to return home, as he now
          intended doing. But nothing was lost as yet. There was another day ahead, and he swore
          that he would not rest until he had found again the beautiful <rs ref="woman"
            type="character">
            woman
          </rs> whose dazzling nakedness had so intoxicated him. It was
          only now that he thought of <rs ref="Albertina" type="character">
            Albertina
          </rs> , but with a feeling that she, too, would first
          have to be won. He could not, must not, be reunited with her until he had deceived her
          with all the other women of the night. With the naked <rs ref="woman" type="character">
          woman
          </rs> , with <rs ref="Pierrette" type="character">
            Pierrette

          </rs> , with <rs ref="Mizzi" type="character">
            Mizzi
          </rs> in the narrow street. And shouldn't he also try to find
          the insolent student who had bumped into him, so that he might challenge him to a duel
          with sabres or, better still, with pistols? What did someone else's life, what did his
          own, matter to him? Is one always to stake one's life just from a sense of duty or
          self-sacrifice, and never because of a whim or a passion, or simply to match oneself
          against Fate? Again the thought came to him that even now the germ of a fatal disease
          might be in his body. Wouldn't it be silly to die just because a child with diphtheria had
          coughed in his face? Perhaps he was already ill. Wasn't he feverish? Perhaps at this
          moment he was lying at home in bed—and everything he thought he had experienced was merely
          delirium? </p>
        <p>
          <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> opened his eyes as wide as possible, passed his hand
          over his forehead and cheeks and felt his pulse. It scarcely beat faster. Everything was
          all right. He was completely awake. He continued along the street, towards the city. A few
          market-wagons rumbled by, and now and then he met poorly dressed people whose day was just
          beginning. Behind the window of a coffee-house, at a table over which a gas-flame
          flickered, sat a fat man with a scarf around his neck, his head on his hands, fast asleep.
          The houses were still enveloped in darkness, though here and there a few windows were
          lighted and <rs
            ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
            Fridolin
          </rs> thought he could feel the people gradually awaking.
          It seemed that he could see them stretching themselves in their beds and preparing for
          their pitiful and strenuous day. A new day faced him, too, but for him it wasn't pitiful
          and dull. And with a strange, happy beating of his heart, he realized that in a few hours
          he would be walking around between the beds of his patients in his white hospital coat. A
          one-horse cab stood at the next corner, the coachman asleep on the box. <rs

        <p>IT was four o'clock in the morning when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>
          walked up the steps of his home. Before doing anything else he went into his office and
          carefully locked the masquerade costume in a closet. As he wished not to wake <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>, he took off his shoes and clothes before
          going into the bedroom, and very cautiously turned on the light on the little table beside
          his bed. <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> was lying there quietly, with
          her arms folded under her head. Her lips were half-open, and painful shadows surrounded
          them. It was a face that <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> did not know. He
          bent down over her, and at once her forehead became lined with furrows, as though someone
          had touched it, and her features seemed strangely distorted. Suddenly, still in her sleep,
          she laughed so shrilly that he became frightened. Involuntarily he called her name. She
          laughed again, as if in answer, in a strange, almost uncanny manner. <rs type="person"

            Fridolin</rs> called her in a louder voice, and she opened her eyes, slowly and with
          difficulty. She stared at him, as though she did not recognize him.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Albertina!"</said>
          he cried for the third time. As she gained consciousness, an expression of fear, even of
          terror came into her eyes. Half awake, and seemingly in despair, she raised her arms.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"What's the matter?"</said>
          asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with bated breath. As she still
          stared at him, terrified, he added, to reassure her: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"It is I, Albertina."</said> She breathed deeply,
          tried to smile, dropped her arms on the bed cover and said, in a far away voice: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Is it morning yet?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"It will be very
          soon,"</said> replied <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, <said aloud="true"
            direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"it's past four o'clock. I've just come home."</said>
          She was silent and he continued: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Albertina">"The Councilor is dead. He was dying when I arrived, and naturally
            I couldn't—leave
            immediately."</said></p>

        <p>She nodded, but hardly seemed to have heard or understood him. She stared into space, as
          though
          she could see through him. He felt that she must know of his recent experiences—and at the
          same time
          the idea seemed ridiculous. He bent down and touched her forehead. She shuddered slightly.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"What's the matter?"</said>
          he asked again.</p>

        <p>She shook her head slowly and he passed his hand gently over her hair. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Albertina, what's the matter?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"I've been
            dreaming,"</said> she said distantly.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"What have you been
          dreaming?"</said> he asked mildly.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Oh, so much, I can't
            quite remember."</said>
        </p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Perhaps if you try?"</said>
        </p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"It was all so
            confused—and I'm tired. You must be tired, too."</said>
        </p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Not in the least. I
          don't think I shall go to bed at all. You know, when I come home so late—it would really
            be
            best to sit right down to my desk—it's just in such morning hours—"</said> He
          interrupted himself. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Wouldn't
          it
            be better if you told me your dream?"</said> He smiled a little unnaturally.</p>

        <p>She replied: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"You
          really
            ought to lie down and take a little rest."</said></p>

        <p>He hesitated a moment, then he did as she suggested and stretched himself beside her,
          though
          he was
          careful not to touch her. There shall be a sword between us, he thought, remembering a
          remark he had
          once made, half joking, on a similar occasion. They lay there silently with open eyes, and
          they felt both
          their proximity and the distance that separated them. After a while he raised his head on
          his arm and
          looked at her for a long time, as though he could see much more than just the outlines of
          her face.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Your dream!"</said>
          he hinted, once more. She must just have been waiting for him to speak. She held out her
          hand to him, he took it and, more absent-mindedly than tenderly, clasped his hand about
          her slender fingers, as he had often done before. She began: <said aloud="true"
            direct="true"
            who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Do you still remember the room in the little villa
          on Lake Worther, where I lived with Mother and Father the summer we became engaged?"</said></p>

        <p>He nodded.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Well, it was there
            the
            dream began. I was entering this house, like an actress stepping onto the
            stage—I don't know where I came from. My parents seemed to have gone on a journey and
            left me
            alone. That surprised me, for our wedding was the next day. But my wedding-dress hadn't
            yet arrived. I
            thought I might be mistaken, and I opened the wardrobe to look. Instead of the wedding
            dress a great
            many other clothes, like fancy dress costumes, were hanging there, opera-like, gorgeous,
            Oriental. Which
            shall I wear for the wedding? I thought. Then the wardrobe was suddenly closed again, or
            it disappeared,
            I don't remember. The room was brightly lighted, but outside the window it was pitch
            black . . . Suddenly
            you were standing out there. Galley slaves had rowed you to the house. I had just seen
            them
            disappearing in the darkness. You were dressed in marvelous gold and silver clothes, and
            had a dagger in
            a silver sheath hanging by your side. You lifted me down from the window. I, too, was
            gorgeously
            dressed, like a princess. We stood outside in the twilight, and a fine gray mist reached
            up to our ankles.
            The country-side was perfectly familiar to us: there was the lake, the mountain rose
            above us, and I
            could even see the villas which stood there like little toy houses. We were floating,
            no, flying, along
            above the mist, and I thought: so this is our honeymoon trip. Soon, however, we stopped
            flying and were
            walking along a forest path, the one leading to Elizabeth Heights. Suddenly, we came
            into a sort of
            clearing in the mountains enclosed on three sides by the forest, while a steep wall of
            rock towered up in
            the back. The sky was blue and starry, with an expanse far greater than it ever has in
            reality; it was the
            ceiling of our bridal-chamber. You took me into your arms and loved me very much."</said>
        </p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"I hope you loved
            me,
            too,"</said> remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with an invisible,
          malicious smile.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Even more than you
          did
            me,"</said> replied <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> seriously, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"but, how can I explain
          it—in spite of the
            intensity of our happiness our love was also sad, as if filled with some presentiment of
          sorrow. Suddenly,
            it was morning. The meadow was light and covered with flowers, the forest glistened with
          dew, and over
            the rocky wall the sun sent down quivering rays of light. It was now time to return to
          the world and go
            among people. But something terrible happened: our clothes were gone. I was seized with
          unheard of
            terror and a shame so burning that it almost consumed me. At the same time I was angry
          with you, as
            though you were to blame for the misfortune. This sensation of terror, shame and anger
          was much more
            intense than anything I had ever felt when awake. Conscious of your guilt, you rushed
          away naked, to go
            and get clothes for us. When you had gone I was very gay. I neither felt sorry for you,
          nor worried about
            you. Delighted to be alone, I ran happily about in the meadow singing a tune we had
            heard at some
            dance. My voice had a wonderful ring and I wished that they could hear me down in the
          city, which I
            couldn't see but which nevertheless existed. It was far below me and was surrounded by a
          high wall, a
            very fantastic city which I can't describe. It was not Oriental and not exactly
          Old-German, and yet it
            seemed to be first one, and then the other. At any rate, it was a city buried a long
            time ago and forever.
            Suddenly I was lying in the meadow, stretched out in the sunlight—far more beautiful
            than I ever was in
            reality, and while I lay there, a young man wearing a light-colored fashionable suit of
          clothes walked out
            of the woods. I now realize that he looked like the Dane whom I mentioned yesterday. He
          walked up and
            spoke to me courteously as he passed, but otherwise paid no particular attention to me.
          He went
            straight to the wall of rock and looked it over carefully, as though considering how to
          master it. At the
            same time I could see you hurrying from house to house, from shop to shop in the buried
          city, now
            walking underneath arbors, then passing through a sort of Turkish bazaar. You were
            buying the most
            beautiful things you could find for me: clothes, linen, shoes, and jewelry. And then you
          put these things
            into a little hand-bag of yellow leather that held them all. You were being followed by
            a crowd of people
            whom I could not see, but I heard the sound of their threatening shouts. The Dane, who
          had stopped
            before the wall of rock a little while before, now reappeared from the woods—and
          apparently in the
            meantime he had encircled the whole globe. He looked different, but he was the same,
          nevertheless. He
            stopped before the wall of rock, vanished and came out of the woods again, appearing and
          disappearing
            two, or three, or a hundred times. It was always the same man and yet always different.
          He spoke to me
            every time he passed, and finally stopped in front of me and looked at me searchingly. I
          laughed
            seductively as I have never laughed in my life, and he held out his arms to me. I wished
          to escape but it
            was useless—and he sank down beside me on the meadow."</said></p>

        <p>She was silent. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s throat was parched. In
          the darkness of the room he could see she had concealed her face in her hands.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"A strange dream,"</said>
          he said, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"but surely
          that isn't the end?"</said> When she said <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina"
            listener="Fridolin">"no,"</said> he asked: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Then why
            don't you continue?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"It's not easy,"</said>
          she began again. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Such
          things are difficult to express in words. Well, to go on—I
            seemed to live through countless days and nights; there was neither time nor space. I
            was no longer in
            the clearing, enclosed by the woods and rock. I was on a flower-covered plain, that
          stretched into infinite
            distance and, finally, into the horizon in all directions. And for a long time I had not
          been alone with this
            one man on the meadow. Whether there were three, .or ten, or a thousand other couples I
          don't know.
            Whether I noticed them or not, whether I was united only with that particular man or
            also with others, I
            can't say. Just as that earlier feeling of terror and shame went beyond anything I have
          ever felt in the
            waking state, so nothing in our conscious existence can be compared with the feeling of
          release, of
            freedom, of happiness, which I now experienced. Yet I didn't for one moment forget you.
          In fact, I saw
            that you had been seized—by soldiers, I think—and there were also priests among them.
          Somebody, a
            gigantic person, tied your hands, and I knew that you were to be executed. I knew it,
          without feeling any
            sympathy for you, and without shuddering. I felt it, but as though I were far removed
          from you. They led
            you into a yard, a sort of castle-yard, and you stood there, naked, with your hands tied
          behind your back.
            Just as I saw you, though I was far away, you could also see me and the man who was
          holding me in his
            arms. All the other couples, too, were visible in this infinite sea of nakedness which
          foamed about me,
            and of which my companion and I were only a wave, so to speak. Then, while you were
          standing in the
            castle-yard, a young woman, with a diadem on her head and wearing a purple cloak,
          appeared at a high
            arched window between red curtains. It was the queen of the country, and she looked down
          at you with
            a stern, questioning look. You were standing alone. All the others stood aside, pressed
          against the wall,
            and I heard them whispering and muttering in a malicious and threatening manner. Then
            the queen bent
            down over the railing. Silence reigned, and she signaled to you, commanding you to come
          up to her, and
            I knew that she had decided to pardon you. But you either didn't notice her, or else you
          didn't want to.
            Suddenly you were standing opposite her, with your hands still tied. You were wrapped in
          a black cloak,
            and you were not in a room, but in the open, somehow, floating, as it were. She held a
          piece of
            parchment in her hand, your death-sentence, which stated your crime and the reasons for
          your
            conviction. She asked you—I couldn't hear the words, but I knew it was so—whether you
          were willing to
            be her lover, for in that case the death-penalty would be remitted. You shook your head,
          refusing. I
            wasn't surprised, for it seemed natural and inevitable that you should be faithful to
            me, under all
            circumstances. The queen shrugged her shoulders, waved her hand, and suddenly you were
            in a
            subterranean cellar, and whips were whizzing down upon you, although I couldn't see the
          people who
            were swinging them. Blood flowed down you in streams. I saw it without feeling cruel, or
          even surprised.
            The queen now moved towards you, her loose hair flowing about her naked body, and held
          out her
            diadem to you with both hands. I realized that she was the girl at the seashore in
          Denmark, the one you
            had once seen nude, in the morning, on the ledge of a bathing-hut. She didn't say a
            word, but she was
            clearly there to learn if you would be her husband and the ruler of the land. When you
          refused again, she
            suddenly disappeared. At the same time I saw them erecting a cross for you—not down in
          the castle-
            yard, but on the meadow, where I was resting with my lover among all the other couples.
            I saw you
            walking alone through ancient streets without a guard, but I knew that your course was
          marked out for
            you and that it was impossible for you to turn aside. Next, you were coming up the
            forest path, where I
            anxiously awaited you, but I did not feel any sympathy for you, though your body was
          covered with the
            weals which had stopped bleeding. You went higher and higher, the path widened, the
          forest receded on
            both sides, and you stood at the edge of the meadow at an enormous, incomprehensible
          distance. Your
            eyes smiled at me as if to show that you had fulfilled my wish and had brought me
          everything I needed:
            clothing and shoes and jewels. But I thought your actions senseless beyond description
          and I wanted to
            make fun of you, to laugh in your face—because you had refused the queen's hand out of
          faithfulness to
            me. And because you had been tortured and now came tottering up here to a horrible
            death. As I ran to
            meet you, you came near more and more quickly. We were floating in the air, and then I
          lost sight of
            you; and I realized we had flown past each other. I hoped that you would, at least, hear
          my laughter
            when they were nailing you to the cross.—And so I laughed, as shrill and loud as I
          could—that was the
            laugh, Fridolin, that you heard—when I awoke."</said> Neither of them spoke or moved.
          Any remark at this moment would have seemed futile. The further her story progressed, the
          more ridiculous and insignificant did his own experiences become, at least up to date. He
          swore to himself that he would resume and conclude all of them. He would then faithfully
          report them and so take vengeance on this woman who had revealed herself as faithless,
          cruel and treacherous, and whom he now believed he hated more than he had ever loved her.</p>

        <p>He realized that he was still clasping her fingers. Ready as he was to hate her, his
          feeling
          of tenderness
          for these slender, cool fingers was unchanged except that it was more acute.
          Involuntarily,
          in fact against
          his will, he gently pressed his lips on this familiar hand before he let it go.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> still kept her eyes closed and <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought he could see a happy, innocent smile
          playing about her mouth. He felt an incomprehensible desire to bend over her and kiss her
          pale forehead. But he checked himself. He realized that it was only the natural fatigue of
          the last few hours which disguised itself as tenderness in the familiarity of their mutual
          room.</p>

        <p>But whatever his present state of mind— whatever decisions he might reach in the next few
          hours, the urgent demand of the moment was for sleep and forgetfulness. He had been able
          to sleep long and dreamlessly the night following the death of his <rs type="person"
            ref="#FridolinMother">mother</rs>, so why not now? He stretched himself out beside his
          wife who seemed already asleep. A sword between us, he thought, we are lying here like
          mortal enemies. But it was only an illusion.</p>

        <p>AT seven o'clock <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> was awakened by the maid
          gently knocking on the door, and he cast a quick glance at <rs type="person"

          was sleeping soundly; too soundly <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought.
          He dressed himself quickly, intending to see his little daughter before leaving. The child
          lay quietly in her white bed, her hands clenched into little fists, as children do in
          sleep, and he kissed her on her forehead. Tip-toeing to the door of the bedroom he found <rs

          The cassock and pilgrim's hat were safely concealed in his black doctor's bag. He had
          drawn up a program for the day with great care, indeed, even a bit pedantically. First of
          all he had to see a young attorney in the neighborhood who was seriously ill. <rs
            type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> made a careful examination and found his condition
          somewhat improved. He expressed his satisfaction with sincere joy and ordered an old
          prescription to be refilled. Then he went to the house in the basement of which Nachtigall
          had played the piano the night before. The place was still closed, but the girl at the
          counter in the cafe above said that <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Nachtigall</rs>
          lived in a small hotel in Leopoldstadt. He took a cab and arrived there a quarter of an
          hour later. It was a very shabby place, smelling of unaired beds, rancid lard and chicory.
          A tough looking concierge, with sly, inflamed eyes, wishing to keep on good terms with the
          police, willingly gave information. <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Herr Nachtigall</rs>
          had arrived in a cab at five o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men who had
          disguised their faces, perhaps intentionally so, with scarfs which they wore wrapped about
          their heads and necks. While <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Nachtigall</rs> was in
          his room, the two men had paid his bill for the last four weeks. When he didn't appear
          after half an hour, one of them had gone up to fetch him, whereupon they all three took a
          cab to North Station. <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Nachtigall</rs> had seemed
          highly excited, in fact—well, why not tell the whole truth to a man who gave one so much
          confidence—he had tried to slip a letter to the concierge, but the two men stopped that.
          Any letters for <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Herr Nachtigall</rs>—so the men had
          explained— would be called for by a person properly authorized to do so. <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> took his leave. He was glad that he had his doctor's bag
          with him when he stepped out of the door, for anyone seeing him would not think that he
          was staying at the hotel, but would take him for some official person. There was nothing
          to be done about <rs type="person" ref="#Nachtigall">Nachtigall</rs> for the time being.
          They had been extremely cautious, probably with good reason.</p>

        <p>At the costume shop, <rs type="person" ref="#Gibiser">Herr Gibiser</rs> himself opened
          the door. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"I'm bringing
          back
            the costume I hired,"</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"and would like to pay my
          bill."</said> The proprietor mentioned a moderate sum, took the money and made an entry in
          a large ledger. He looked up, evidently surprised, when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> made no move to leave.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"I would also like,"</said>
          said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> in the tone of a police magistrate, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"to have a word with you
          about your
            daughter."</said></p>

        <p>There was a peculiar expression about the nostrils of <rs type="person" ref="#Gibiser">Herr
          Gibiser</rs>—it was difficult to say whether it was displeasure, scorn or annoyance.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Gibiser" listener="Fridolin">"What did you say?"</said>
          he asked in a perfectly indefinite voice.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"Yesterday you said,"</said>
          remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, one hand with outstretched
          fingers resting on the desk, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Gibiser">"that
            your daughter was not quite normal mentally. The situation in which we discovered her
          actually
            indicates some such thing. And since I took part in it, or was at least a spectator, I
          would very much like
            to advise you to consult a doctor."</said></p>

        <p>Gibiser surveyed <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> insolently, twirling an
          unnaturally long pen-holder in his hand.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Gibiser" listener="Fridolin">"And I suppose the
            doctor
            himself would like to take charge of the treatment?"</said>
        </p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"Please don't
          misunderstand me,"</said> replied <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> in a
          sharp voice.</p>

        <p>At this moment the door which led to the inner rooms was opened, and a young man with an
          open top-coat over his evening clothes stepped out. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> decided it could be none other than one of the vehmic judges of the night
          before. He undoubtedly came from Pierrette's room. He seemed taken aback when he caught
          sight of <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, but he regained his composure at once. He
          waved his hand to Gibiser, lighted a cigarette with a match from the desk, and left the
          apartment.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"Oh, that's how it
            is,"</said> remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with a contemptuous
          twitch of his mouth and a bitter taste on his tongue.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Gibiser" listener="Fridolin">"What did you say?"</said>
          asked Gibiser with perfect equanimity.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Gibiser">"So you have changed
          your
            mind about notifying the police,"</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>
          as his eyes wandered significantly from the entrance door to that of Pierrette.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Gibiser" listener="Fridolin">"We have come to
          another
            agreement,"</said> remarked Gibiser coldly, and got up as though this were the end of an
          interview. He obligingly opened the door as <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>
          turned to go and said, without changing his expression: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Gibiser" listener="Fridolin">"If the doctor should want anything again ... it
          needn't necessarily be a monk's costume."</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> slammed the door behind him. So that is
          settled, he thought, as he hurried down the stairs with a feeling of annoyance which, even
          to him, seemed exaggerated. The first thing he did on arriving at the Polyclinic was to
          telephone home to inquire whether any patients had sent for him, if there was any mail, or
          any other news. The maid had scarcely answered him when <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">
          Albertina</rs> herself came to the phone to answer <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs>'s call. She repeated everything the maid had already told him, and then said
          casually that she had just got up and was going to have breakfast with the child. <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="maid">"Give her a kiss for me,"</said>
          said Fridolin, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="maid">"and I hope
          you enjoy your breakfast."</said></p>

        <p>It had been pleasant to hear her voice but he quickly hung up the receiver. Although he
          had
          really
          wanted to know what she planned to do during the forenoon, what business was it of his?
          Down
          in the
          bottom of his heart he was through with her, no matter how their surface life continued.
          The
          blond
          nurse helped him to take off his coat and handed him his white linen one, smiling at him
          just as they all
          did, whether one paid attention to them or not.</p>

        <p>A few minutes later he was in the ward. The physician in charge had suddenly sent word
          that he had to leave the city for a conference, and that the assistants should make the
          rounds without him. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> felt almost happy as
          he walked from bed to bed, followed by the students, making examinations, writing
          prescriptions, and having professional conversations with the assistants and nurses.
          Various changes had taken place. The journeyman-locksmith, Karl Rodel, had died during the
          night and the autopsy was to take place at half past four in the afternoon. A bed had
          become vacant in the woman's ward, but was again occupied. The woman in bed seventeen had
          had to be transferred to the surgical division. Besides this, there was a lot of personal
          gossip. The appointment of a man for the ophthalmology division would be decided day after
          tomorrow. Hiigelmann, at present professor at the University of Marburg, had the best
          chances, although four years ago he had been merely a second assistant to Stellwag. That's
          quick promotion, thought <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. I'll never be considered for the headship
          of a department, if for no other reason than that I've never been a Dozent. It's too late.
          But why should it be? I really ought to begin again to do scientific work or take up more
          seriously some of the things that I have already started. My private practice would leave
          me ample time for it. He asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fuchstaler">Doctor Fuchstaler</rs>
          if he would please take charge of the dispensary. He confessed to himself that he would
          rather have stayed there than drive out to Galitzinberg. And yet, he must. He felt
          obliged, not only for his own sake, to investigate this matter further, but there were all
          sorts of other things to be settled that day. He decided to ask <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fuchstaler">Doctor
            Fuchstaler</rs> to take charge of the afternoon rounds, too, so as to be prepared for
          all emergencies. The young girl, over there, with suspected tuberculosis was smiling at
          him. It was the same one who had recently pressed her breasts so confidingly against his
          cheek when he examined her. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> gave her a
          cold look and turned away with a frown. They are all alike, he thought bitterly, and <rs
            type="person"
            ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> is like the rest of them —if not the worst. I won't live
          with her any longer. Things can never be the same again. On the stairs he spoke to a
          colleague from the surgical division. Well, how was the woman who had been transferred
          during the night getting along? As far as he was concerned, he didn't really think it was
          necessary to operate. They would, of course, tell him the result of the histological
          examination?</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Fuchstaler">"Why certainly,
            doctor."</said>
        </p>

        <p>He took a cab at the corner, consulting his notebook and pretending to the cabman that he
          was
          making up his mind where to go. "To Ottakring" he then said, "take the street going out to
          Galitzinberg.
          /'ll tell you where to stop."</p>

        <p>When he was in the cab he suddenly became terribly restless. In fact, he almost had a
          guilty
          conscience, because, during the last few hours, he had nearly forgotten the beautiful
          woman
          who had
          saved him. Would he now find the house? Well, that shouldn't be particularly difficult.
          The
          only question
          was what to do when he had found it. Notify the police? That might have disastrous
          consequences for
          the woman who had sacrificed herself for him, or had, at least, been ready to do so.
          Should
          he go to a
          private detective agency? He thought that would be in rather bad taste and not
          particularly
          dignified. But
          what else could he possibly do? He hadn't the time or the skill to make the necessary
          investigations. A
          secret club? Well, yes, it certainly was secret, though they seemed to know each other.
          Were
          they
          aristocrats, or perhaps even members of the court? He thought of certain archdukes who
          might
          easily be
          capable of such behavior. And what about the women? Probably they were recruited from
          brothels.
          Well, that was not by any means certain, but at any rate, they seemed very attractive. But
          how about the
          woman who had sacrificed herself for him? Sacrificed? Why did he try, again and again, to
          make himself
          believe that it really was a sacrifice? It had been a joke, of course; the whole thing had
          been a joke and
          he ought to be grateful to have gotten out of the scrape so easily. Well, why not? He had
          preserved his
          dignity, and the cavaliers probably realized that he was nobody's fool. And she must have
          realized it also.
          Very likely she had cared more for him than for all those archdukes or whatever they were.</p>

        <p>He got out at the end of Liebhartstal, where the road led sharply up-hill, and took the
          precaution of sending the cab away. There were white clouds in the pale-blue sky and the
          sun shone with the warmth of spring. He looked back—there was nothing suspicious in sight,
          no cab, no pedestrian. He walked slowly up the road. His coat became heavy. He took it off
          and threw it over his shoulder just as he came to the spot where he thought the
          side-street, in which the mysterious house stood, branched off to the right. He could not
          go wrong. The street went down-hill but not nearly so steeply as it had seemed during the
          night. It was a quiet little street. There were rosebushes carefully covered with straw in
          a front garden, and in the next yard stood a baby carriage. A boy in a blue jersey suit
          was romping about and a laughing young woman watched him from a ground-floor window. Next
          came an empty lot, then an uncultivated fenced-in garden, then a little villa, next a
          lawn, and finally—there was no doubt about it—the house he was looking for. It certainly
          did not seem large or magnificent. It was a one-story villa in modest Empire style and
          obviously renovated a comparatively short time before. The green blinds were down and
          there was nothing to show that anyone lived there. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> looked around. There was no one in the street, except farther down where two
          boys with books under their arms were going in the opposite direction. He stopped in front
          of the garden gate. And what was he to do now? Simply walk back again? That would be too
          ridiculous, he thought, looking for the bell-button. Supposing someone answered it, what
          was he to say? Well, he would simply ask if the pretty country house was to let for the
          summer. But the house-door had already opened and an old servant in plain morning livery
          came out and slowly walked down the narrow path to the gate. He held a letter in his hand
          and silently pushed it through the iron bars to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>
          whose heart was beating wildly.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin">"For me?"</said> he asked, hesitantly.
          The servant nodded, went back to the house, and the door closed behind him. What does that
          mean? <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> asked himself. Can it possibly be from her?
          Does she, herself, own the house? He walked back up the street quickly and it was only
          then that he noticed his name on the envelope in large, dignified letters. He opened it,
          unfolded a sheet and read the following:</p>

        <p>Give up your inquiries which are perfectly useless, and consider these words a second
          warning. We
          hope, for your own good, that this will be sufficient.</p>

        <p>This message disappointed him in every respect, but at any rate it was different from
          what he
          had
          foolishly expected. Nevertheless, the tone of it was strangely reserved, even kindly, and
          seemed to show
          that the people who had sent it by no means felt secure.</p>

        <p>Second warning—? How was that? Oh yes, he had received the first one during the night.
          But
          why
          second warning—and not the last? Did they want to try his courage once more? Was he to
          pass
          a test?
          And how did they know his name? Well, that wasn't difficult. They had probably forced
          Nachtigall to tell.
          And besides—he smiled at his absent-mindedness—his monogram and his full address were sewn
          into
          the lining of his fur coat.</p>

        <p>But, though he had made no progress, the letter on the whole reassured him, just why he
          couldn't say.
          At any rate he was convinced that the woman he was so uneasy about was still alive, and
          that
          it would
          be possible to find her if he went about it cautiously and cleverly.</p>

        <p>He went home, feeling rather tired but with a strange sense of security which somehow
          seemed deceptive. <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> and the child had
          finished their dinner, but they kept him company while he ate his meal. There she sat
          opposite him, the woman who had calmly allowed him to be crucified the preceding night.
          She was sitting there with an angelic look, like a good housewife and mother, and to his
          surprise he did not hate her. He enjoyed his meal, being in an excited, cheerful mood,
          and, as he usually did, gave a very lively account of the little professional incidents of
          the day. He mentioned especially the gossip about the doctors, about whom he always kept <rs
            type="person"
            ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> well informed. He told her that the appointment of
          Hugelmann was as good as settled, and then spoke pf his own determination to take up
          scientific work again with greater energy. <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>
          knew this mood. She also knew that it usually didn't last very long and betrayed her
          doubts by a slight smile. When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> became
          quite warm on the subject, she gently smoothed his hair to calm him. He started slightly
          and turned to the child, so as to remove his forehead from the embarrassing touch. He took
          the little girl on his lap and was just beginning to dance her up and down, when the maid
          announced that several patients were waiting. Fridolin rose with a sigh of relief,
          suggesting to <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> that she and the child ought to go for a
          walk on such a beautiful, sunny afternoon, and went to his consulting room.</p>

        <p>During the next two hours he had to see six old patients and two new ones. In every
          single
          case he had
          his whole mind on the subject. He made examinations, jotted down notes and wrote
          prescriptions—and
          he was glad that he felt so unusually fresh and clear in mind after spending the last two
          nights almost
          without sleep.</p>

        <p>At the end of his consultation period, he stopped to see his wife and little daughter
          once more. He noted with satisfaction that <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>'s
          mother was with her, and that the child was having a French lesson with her governess. It
          was only when he reached the front steps that he realized that all this order, this
          regularity, all the security of his existence, was nothing but deception and delusion.</p>

        <p>Although he had excused himself from his afternoon duties at the hospital, he felt
          irresistibly drawn to his ward. There were two cases there of special importance to the
          piece of research he was planning. He was busy for some time making a more detailed study
          of them than he had yet done, and following that he still had to visit a patient in the
          heart of the city. It was already seven o'clock in the evening when he stood before the
          old house in Schreyvogel Strasse. As he looked up at Marianne's window, her image, which
          had completely faded from his mind, was revived—more clearly than that of all the others.
          Well— there was no chance of failure here. He could begin his work of vengeance without
          any special exertion and with little difficulty or danger. What might have deterred
          others, the betrayal of her fiance, only made him keener. Yes, to betray, to deceive, to
          lie, to play a part, before Marianne, before <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>,
          before the good Doctor Roediger, before the whole world. To lead a sort of double life, to
          be the capable, reliable physician with a future before him, the upright husband and head
          of a family. And at the same time a libertine, a seducer, a cynic who played with people,
          with men and women, just as the spirit moved him— that seemed to him, at the time, very
          delightful. And the most delightful part was that at some future time, long after <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> fancied herself secure in the peacefulness
          of marriage and of—family life—he would confess to her, with a superior smile, all of his
          sins, in retribution for the bitter and shameful things she had committed against him in a
          dream.</p>

        <p>On the steps he met <rs type="person" ref="#Roediger">Doctor Roediger</rs> who held out
          his hand cordially.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Roediger">"How is Fraulein
          Marianne?"</said> asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, <said
            aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Roediger">"is she a little more composed?"</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Roediger">Doctor Roediger</rs> shrugged his shoulders, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Roediger" listener="Fridolin">"She was prepared for the
          end long enough, doctor.—Only when they came this noon to call for the corpse———"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Roediger">"So that's already
          been
            done?"</said> Doctor Roediger nodded. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Roediger"
            listener="Fridolin">"The funeral will be at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon."</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> looked down. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true"
            who="Fridolin" listener="Roediger">"I suppose— Fraulein Marianne's relatives are with
          her?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Roediger" listener="Fridolin">"No,"</said> replied <rs
            type="person" ref="#Roediger">Doctor Roediger</rs>, "she is alone now. She will be
          pleased to see you once more, for tomorrow my mother and I are taking her to Modling."
          When <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> raised his eyes with a politely questioning
          look, <rs type="person" ref="#Roediger">Doctor Roediger</rs> continued: <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Roediger" listener="Fridolin">"My parents have a little house out
          there. Good-bye,
            doctor. I still have many things to attend to. It's unbelievable how much trouble is
          connected with such
            a—case. I hope I shall still find you upstairs when I return."</said> And as he said
          this he reached the street.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> hesitated a moment, then slowly went up
          the stairs. He rang the bell and <rs type="person" ref="#Marianne">Marianne</rs> herself
          opened the door. She was dressed in black and had on a jet necklace which he had never
          seen before. Her face became slightly flushed.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Marianne" listener="Fridolin">"You made me wait a
          long
            time,"</said> she said, smiling feebly.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">"Forgive me, Fraulein
            Marianne, this was a particularly busy day for me."</said>
        </p>

        <p>They passed through the death-chamber, in which the bed was now empty, into the adjoining
          room
          where, under the picture of the officer in a white uniform, he had, the day before written
          the death
          certificate of the Councilor. A little lamp was burning on the writing desk, and it was
          nearly dark.
          Marianne offered him a seat on the black leather divan and sat down opposite him.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">"I have just met
            Doctor
            Roediger. So you are going to the country tomorrow?"</said>
        </p>

        <p>Marianne seemed little surprised at the cool tone of his question and her shoulders
          drooped when he continued almost harshly: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Marianne">"I think that's very sensible."</said> And he explained in a
          matter-of-fact way what a favorable effect the good air and the new environment would have
          on her.</p>

        <p>She sat motionless, and tears streamed down her cheeks. He saw them, feeling impatient
          rather
          than
          sympathetic. The thought that the next minute, perhaps, she might be lying at his feet,
          repeating her
          confession of the night before, filled him with fear. When she said nothing he got up
          suddenly. "Much as
          I regret it, Fraulein Marianne—" He looked at his watch.</p>

        <p>Still crying, she raised her head and looked at <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs>. He would gladly have said something kind to her, but found it difficult to
          do so.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">"I suppose you will
          stay
            in the country for several days,"</said> he began rather awkwardly. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">"I hope you will
            write to me ... By the way, Doctor Roediger says the wedding is to be soon. Let me offer
          you my best
            wishes."</said></p>

        <p>She did not move, as though she had understood neither his congratulations nor his
          farewell. He held out his hand but she refused it, and he repeated almost reproachfully: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Marianne">"Well then, I sincerely
          hope that
            you will keep me posted about your health. Good-bye, Fraulein Marianne."</said></p>

        <p>She sat there as if turned to stone and he left the room, stopping for a second in the
          doorway, as
          though to give her a last opportunity to call him back. But she turned her head away, and
          he
          closed the
          door behind him. When he was out in the hallway he felt rather remorseful and for a moment
          he
          thought of going back, but he felt that it would have been ridiculous to do so.</p>

        <p>But what was he to do now? Go home? Where else could he go? Anyhow, there was nothing
          more he
          could do today. And what about tomorrow? What could he do and how should he go about it?
          He
          felt
          awkward and helpless. Everything he put his hands to turned out a failure. Everything
          seemed
          unreal: his
          home, his wife, his child, his profession, and even he himself, mechanically walking along
          through the
          nocturnal streets with his thoughts roaming through space. The clock on the Rathaus tower
          struck half
          past seven. It didn't matter how late it was; he had more time on his hands than he
          needed.
          There was
          nothing and no one that interested him, and he pitied himself not a little. Then the idea
          occurred to him
          —not deliberately but as a flash across his mind—to drive to some station, take a train,
          no
          matter where,
          and to disappear, leaving everyone behind. He could then turn up again, somewhere abroad,
          and start a
          new life, as a different personality. He recalled certain strange pathological cases which
          he had read in
          books on psychiatry, so called double-lives. A man living in normal circumstances suddenly
          disappeared,
          was not heard from, returned months or years later and didn't remember where he had been
          during this
          time. Later, however, someone who had run across him, somewhere, in a foreign country,
          recognized
          him, but the man himself remembered nothing. Such things certainly didn't happen very
          often,
          but just
          the same they were authentic. Many others probably experienced the same things in a lesser
          degree. For
          instance, when one comes back out of dreams. Of course, one remembers some dreams, but
          there
          must
          be others one completely forgets, of which nothing remains but a mysterious mood, a
          curious
          numbness. Or one doesn't remember until very much later, and doesn't even then know
          whether
          it was
          real or only a dream. Only a dream!</p>

        <p>While <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> wandered along, drifting aimlessly
          towards his home, he entered the neighborhood of the dark, rather questionable street,
          where he had accompanied the forlorn little girl to her humble room less than twenty-four
          hours before. Why was she "forlorn?" And why was just this street "questionable?" Isn't it
          strange how we are misled by words, how we give names to streets, events and people, and
          form judgments about them, just because we are too lazy to change our habits? Wasn't this
          young girl in reality the most charming, if not actually the purest of all those with whom
          he had come in contact during the past night? He felt rather touched when he thought of
          her, and remembering his plan of the night before, he turned into the nearest store and
          bought all kinds of delicacies. Walking along with his package, the consciousness of
          performing an act which was at least sensible, and perhaps actually laudable, made him
          feel glad. Nevertheless, he turned up his coat collar when he stepped into the hallway and
          went upstairs several steps at a time. The bell of the apartment rang with unwelcome
          shrillness and he felt relieved when a disreputable looking woman informed him that
          Fraulein Mizzi was not at home. But before the woman had an opportunity of taking charge
          of the package for Mizzi, another woman joined them. She was still young and not
          bad-looking, and had on a sort of bath-robe. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman"
            listener="Fridolin">"Whom are you
            looking for?"</said> she said, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman"
            listener="Fridolin">"Fraulein Mizzi? Well, she won't be home again for some time."</said></p>

        <p>The older woman made a sign to her to keep quiet, but <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs>, anxious to confirm what he had already half guessed asked very simply: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin">"She's in the hospital, isn't she?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman" listener="Fridolin">"Well, as long as you
          know
            it anyhow. But there's nothing wrong with me, thank heaven,"</said> she exclaimed
          vivaciously and stepped quite close to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>.
          Her lips were half open, and as she boldly drew up her voluptuous body the bath-robe
          parted. <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> declined and said: <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="woman">"I was passing by and I stopped
            to bring something for Mizzi."</said> He suddenly felt very young, but asked in a
          matter-of-fact voice: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="woman">"In
          which
            ward is she?"</said></p>

        <p>The younger woman mentioned the name of a professor in whose clinic <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> had been an assistant several years before, and added
          good-naturedly: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman" listener="Fridolin">"Just let
          me have those packages, I'll take them to her
            tomorrow. And I promise that I won't snitch any of it. I'll give her your regards too
            and tell her that
            you're still true to her."</said></p>

        <p>She stepped closer to him and laughed invitingly but when he drew back a little she gave
          it up at once and said, as if to console him: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman"
            listener="Fridolin">"The doctor said she'd be home in six or, at most, eight weeks."</said></p>

        <p>When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> returned to the street he felt
          choked with tears. He knew that this was not because he was deeply affected, but because
          his nerves were gradually giving way, and he intentionally struck up a quicker and more
          lively pace than he was in the mood for. Was this another and final sign that everything
          was bound to turn out a failure for him? But why should it? The fact that he had escaped
          such a great danger might just as well be a good sign. Was it the all-important thing to
          escape danger? He could expect to face many others, as he was by no means ready to give up
          the search for the marvelous woman of the night before.</p>

        <p>Of course, it was too late to do anything about it now. Besides, he had to consider
          carefully
          just how to
          continue the search.</p>

        <p>If only there were someone he could consult in the matter! But he knew of no one to whom
          he
          was
          willing to confide his adventures of the preceding night. For years he had not exchanged
          confidences
          with anyone except his wife, and of course, he could hardly discuss this case with her.
          Neither this nor
          any other. For, no matter how one looked at it, she had permitted him to be crucified the
          night before.</p>

        <p>And he suddenly realized why he was walking, not towards his house, but, unconsciously,
          farther and farther in the opposite direction. He would not, and could not, face <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> now. The most sensible tiling to do was to
          have supper away from home, then he could go to his ward and look after his two cases. But
          under no circumstances would he go home—"home?"—until he could be certain of finding
          Albertina asleep.</p>

        <p>He entered a cafe, one of the more quiet and select ones near the Rathaus. He telephoned
          home not to expect him for supper, and hung up the receiver quickly so that <rs
            type="person"
            ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> wouldn't have a chance to come to the phone.</p>

        <p>Then he sat down by a window and drew the curtain. A man had just taken a seat in a
          distant corner. He wore a dark overcoat and inconspicuous clothes and <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought he had seen his face before, during the day. It
          might, of course, be just a fancy. He picked up an evening paper, read a few lines here
          and there, just as he had done the night before in a different place. Reports on political
          events, articles on the theatre, art and literature, accounts of accidents and disasters.
          In some city that he had never heard of in the United States a theatre had burned down.
          Peter Korand, a chimney-sweep, had thrown himself out of a window. Somehow, it seemed
          strange to <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> that even chimney-sweeps occasionally commit
          suicide. Involuntarily he wondered whether the man had first washed himself properly or
          whether he had plunged into nothingness just as he was, black and dirty. A woman had taken
          poison that morning in a fashionable hotel in the heart of the city. She was an unusually
          good-looking woman and had registered there a few days before under the name of Baroness
          D. At once <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> felt a strange presentiment.
          The woman had returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men
          who had left her at the door. Four o'clock! That was exactly the time that he, too, had
          reached home. About noontime—the account continued—she had been found unconscious in her
          bed with every indication of serious poisoning. . . . An unusually good-looking woman. . .
          . Well, there were many unusually good-looking women. . . . There was no reason to believe
          that Baroness D., or rather the woman who had registered as such, and a certain other
          person, were one and the same. And yet—his heart throbbed and his hand trembled as it held
          the paper. In a fashionable hotel . . . which one—? Why so mysterious?—so discreet? . . .</p>

        <p>He put the paper down and at the same time the man in the far corner raised his, a large,
          illustrated journal, and held it to shield his face. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> at once picked up his paper again and decided that the Baroness D. must
          certainly be the woman he had seen the night before. In a fashionable hotel. . . . There
          were not many which would be considered—by a Baroness D. . . . Whatever happened now, this
          clue had to be followed up. He called for the waiter, paid his bill and left. At the door
          he turned to look for the suspicious character in the corner, but strange to say, he was
          already gone. . . .</p>

        <p>Serious poisoning. . . . But she was still living. . . . She was living when they found
          her. There was really no reason to suppose that she had not been saved. In any case, he
          would find her—whether she lived or not. And he would see her—dead or alive. He would see
          her; no one in the world could stop his seeing the woman who had died on his account; who
          had, in fact, died for him. He was the cause of her death— he alone—if it were she. Yes,
          it was she. Returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men!
          Very likely the same men who had taken <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Nachtigall</rs>
          to the station a few hours later. This did not seem to point to a very clear conscience.</p>

        <p>He stood in the large Square before the Rathaus and looked around. There were only a few
          people in sight and the suspicious looking man from the cafe was not among them. But even
          if he were—the men had been afraid—<rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> had the
          upper hand. He hurried on, took a cab when he reached the Ring, and driving first to the
          Hotel Bristol, asked the concierge, as though he were fully authorized to do so, whether
          the <rs
            type="person" ref="#Baroness">Baroness D.</rs> who had taken poison that morning, had
          stopped at this hotel. The concierge didn't seem at all surprised; perhaps he thought <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> was a police officer or some other official.
          At any rate, he replied courteously that the sad case had not occurred there, but in the
          Hotel Erzherzog Karl. . . .</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> at once went there and found that
          Baroness D. had been taken to the General Hospital immediately after they found her. He
          also inquired how they had discovered her attempt at suicide. Why had they disturbed at
          noon a lady who had not returned until four in the morning? Well, it was quite simple; two
          men (the two men again!) had asked for her at eleven o'clock in the morning. The lady had
          not answered her telephone, although they had rung several times, and when the maid
          knocked on her door, there was no answer. It was locked on the inside. Finally, they had
          had to break it open, and they found the Baroness in her bed, unconscious. They had at
          once called an ambulance and notified the police.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin">"And the two men?"</said> asked <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, rather sharply. He felt like a detective.</p>

        <p>Yes, of course the two men looked rather suspicious. In the meantime they had completely
          disappeared. Anyhow, it was unlikely that she was really the <rs type="person"
            ref="#Baroness">Baroness Dubieski</rs>, the name under which she had registered. This
          was the first time she had stopped at the hotel. Besides, there wasn't a family by that
          name; at least none belonging to the nobility.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thanked the concierge for the information
          and left quickly, for one of the hotel managers had just come up and looked him over with
          unpleasant curiosity. He got back into the cab and told the cabman to take him to the
          hospital. A few minutes later, in the outside office, he learned that the allege <rs
            type="person" ref="#Baroness">Baroness Dubieski</rs> had been taken to the second clinic
          for internal medicine. In spite of all the efforts of the doctors, she had died at five in
          the afternoon— without having regained consciousness.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> breathed a sigh of relief that sounded
          now like a deep groan. The official on duty looked up, startled, and <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> pulled himself together and courteously took his leave. A
          minute later he stood again out-doors. The hospital park was empty except where a nurse,
          in her blue and white uniform and cap, was walking along a near-by path. <said aloud="no"
            direct="false" who="Fridolin">"She is dead,"</said> <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> said to himself.—If it is she. And if it is not? If she still lives, how can
          I find her? Only too easily could <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> answer
          the question as to where at that moment he could find the body of the unknown woman. As
          she had died so recently, she was undoubtedly lying in the hospital morgue, a few hundred
          paces away. As a doctor, there would, of course, be no difficulty in gaining admittance
          there, even at such a late hour. But—what did he want there? He had never seen her face,
          only her body. He had only snatched a hasty glance at the former when he had been driven
          out. Up to this moment he hadn't thought of that fact. During the time since he had read
          the account in the paper he had pictured the suicide, whose face he didn't know, as having
          the features of <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>. In fact, he now shuddered to realize that
          his wife had constantly been in his mind's eye as the woman he was seeking. He asked
          himself again why he really wanted to go to the morgue. He was sure that if he had met her
          again alive—whether days or years later, whatever the circumstances—he would
          unquestionably have recognized her by her gait, her bearing, and above all by her voice.
          But now he was to see only the body again, the dead body of a woman, and a face of which
          he remembered only the eyes, now lifeless. Yes—he knew those eyes, and the hair which had
          suddenly become untied and had enveloped her naked body as they had driven him from the
          room. Would that be enough to tell him if it were unmistakably she?</p>

        <p>With slow and hesitating steps he crossed the familiar courtyards to the Institute of
          Pathological Anatomy. Finding the door unlocked, it was unnecessary to ring the bell. The
          stone floor resounded under his footsteps as he walked through the dimly lighted hall. A
          familiar, and to a certain extent homelike, smell of all kinds of chemicals pervaded the
          place. He knocked on the door of the Histological Room where he expected to find some
          assistant still at work. A rather gruff voice called "Come in." <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> entered the high-ceilinged room which seemed almost
          festively illuminated. As he half expected, <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs>,
          an assistant in the Institute and an old fellow-student of his, was in the center of the
          room. He raised his eyes from the microscope and arose from his chair.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Oh, it's you,"</said>
          he said to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, a little annoyed, but also
          surprised, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"to what do I
          owe the honor of
            your visit at such an unaccustomed hour?"</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"Forgive me for
          disturbing
            you,"</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"I see you are just in the midst of some
          work."</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Yes, I am,"</said>
          replied Alder in the sharp voice which he retained from his student days. He added in a
          lighter tone: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"What else
          could one
            be doing in these sacred halls at midnight? But, of course, you're not
            disturbing me in the least. What can I do for you?"</said></p>

        <p>When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> did not answer, he continued: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"That Addison case you sent
          down to us today is still lying
            over there, lovely and inviolate. Dissection tomorrow morning at eight-thirty."</said></p>

        <p>With a gesture <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> indicated that that was
          not the reason of his visit. <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs> went on: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Oh,then it's the pleural
          tumor. Well, the histological examination has unmistakably shown sarcoma. So you
            needn't worry about that either."</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> again shook his head. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"My visit has nothing to do with—official
          matters."</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Well, so much the
          better,"</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Adler</rs>. <said aloud="true"
            direct="true" who="ADler"
            listener="Fridolin">"I was beginning to think that your bad conscience brought you
            down here when all good people should be sleeping."</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"It has something to do
          with
            a bad conscience, or at least with conscience in general,"</said> <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> replied.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Oh!"</said>
        </p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"Briefly, and to the
          point,"</said>—he spoke in a dry, off-hand tone—<said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Fridolin"
            listener="Adler">"I should like to have some information
            about a woman who died of morphine poisoning in the second clinic this evening. She is
          likely to be
            down here now, a certain Baroness Dubieski."</said> He continued more hurriedly: <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"I have a feeling that this
            so
            called Baroness is a person I knew casually years ago, and I am interested to know if j
          am right——."</said>
<said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">
          "Suicidium?"</said> asked <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Adler</rs>. <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> nodded. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="ADler">"Yes, suicide,"</said> he translated, as though he wished to restore
          the matter to a personal plane.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Adler</rs> jokingly pointed his finger at him. <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Was she unhappily in love
          with your Excellency?"</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> was a little annoyed and answered, <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"The suicide of the Baroness
          Dubieski has nothing
            whatever to do with me personally."</said></p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"I beg your pardon, I
            didn't mean to be indiscreet. We can see for ourselves at once. As far as I know,
            no request from the coroner has come tonight. Very likely———"</said>
        </p>

        <p>Post-mortem examination—flashed across <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s
          mind. That might easily be the case. Who knows whether her suicide was in any sense
          voluntary? He thought again of the two men who had so suddenly disappeared from the hotel
          after learning of her attempt at suicide. The affair might still develop into a criminal
          case of great importance. And mightn't he—<rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>—perhaps
          be summoned as a witness?—In fact, wasn't it really his duty to report to the police?</p>

        <p>He followed <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs> across the hallway to the
          door opposite, which was ajar. The bare high room was dimly lighted by the low, unshaded
          flames of a two-armed gas-fixture. Less than half of the twelve or fourteen morgue tables
          were occupied by corpses. A few bodies were lying there naked. Others were covered with
          linen sheets. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> stepped up to the first
          table by the door and carefully drew back the covering from the head of the corpse. A
          glare from Doctor Adler's flashlight suddenly fell upon it and Fridolin saw the yellow
          face of a gray-bearded man. He immediately covered it again with the shroud. On the next
          table was the naked, emaciated body of a young man, and <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor
          Adler</rs> called out from farther down: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler"
            listener="Fridolin">"Here's
            a woman between sixty and seventy, so I suppose she isn't the one either."</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> suddenly felt irresistibly drawn to the
          end of the room where the sallow body of a woman faintly glowed in the darkness. The head
          was hanging to one side and the long dark hair almost touched the floor. He instinctively
          stretched out his hand to put the head in its proper position, but feeling a certain dread
          which, as a doctor, was otherwise unknown to him he drew back his hand. <rs type="person"
            ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs> came up and, pointing to the corpses behind him, remarked
          : <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"All those are out of
          the
            question, so it's
            probably this one?"</said> He pointed his flashlight at the woman's head. Overcoming his
          dread, <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> raised it a little with his hands.
          A white face with halfclosed eyelids stared at him. The lower jaw hung down limply, the
          narrow upper lip was drawn up, revealing the bluish gums and a number of white teeth. <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> could not tell whether this face had ever
          been beautiful, even as lately as the day before. It was a face without any expression or
          character. It was dead. It could just as easily have been the face of a woman of eighteen,
          as of thirty-eight.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Is it she?"</said>
          asked <rs
            type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs>.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> bent lower, as though he could, with his
          piercing look, wrest an answer from the rigid features. Yet at the same time he knew that
          if it were her face, and her eyes, the eyes that had shone at him the day before with so
          much passion, he would not, could not—and in reality did not, want to know. He gently laid
          the head back on the table. His eyes followed the moving flashlight, passing along the
          dead body. Was it her body?—the wonderful alluring body for which, only yesterday, he had
          felt such agonizing desire? <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> touched the
          forehead, the cheeks, the shoulders and arms of the dead woman, doing so as if compelled
          and directed by an invisible power. He twined his fingers about those of the corpse, and
          rigid as they were, they seemed to him to make an effort to move, to seize his hand.
          Indeed, he almost felt that a vague and distant look from underneath her eyelids was
          searching his face. He bent over her, as if magically attracted.</p>

        <p>Suddenly he heard a voice behind him whispering: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Adler"
            listener="Fridolin">"What on earth are you doing?"</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> regained his senses instantly. He freed
          his fingers from those of the corpse, and taking her thin wrists, placed the ice-cold arms
          alongside of the body very carefully, even a little scrupulously. It seemed to him that
          she had just at that moment died. He turned away, directed his steps to the door and
          across the resounding hallway back into the room which they had left a little while
          before. Doctor Adler followed in silence and locked the door behind them.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> stepped up to the wash-basin. <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"With your permission,"</said>
          he said and carefully washed his hands with disinfectant. Doctor Adler seemed anxious to
          continue his interrupted work without further ceremony. He switched on his microscope
          lamp, turned the micrometer screw and looked into the microscope. When <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> went up to him to say good-bye he was already completely
          absorbed.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Would you like to have
            a
            look at this preparation?"</said> he asked.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"Why?"</said> asked <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> absent-mindedly.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Well, to quiet your
          conscience,"</said> replied <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs>—as if he
          assumed that, after all, the purpose of Fridolin's visit had been a medical-scientific
          one.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Can you make it out?"</said>
          he asked, as <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> looked into the microscope. <said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"It's a fairly new staining
          method."</said></p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> nodded, without raising his eyes from the
          glass. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"Perfectly ideal,"</said>
          he said, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"a colorful
          picture,
            one might say."</said></p>

        <p>And he inquired about various details of the new technique.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs> gave him the desired explanations. <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> told him that the new method would most
          probably be very useful to him in some work he was planning for the next few months, and
          asked permission to come again to get more information.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"I'm always at your
          service,"</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs>. He accompanied <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> over the resounding flagstones to the locked
          outer door, and opened it with his own key.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"You're not going yet?"</said>
          asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>.</p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"Of course not,"</said>
          replied <rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs>. <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Adler" listener="Fridolin">"These are the very best hours for work— from about
          midnight
            until morning. Then one is at least fairly certain not to be disturbed."</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Adler">"Well"</said>—said <rs
            type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, smiling slightly, as if he had a guilty
          conscience.</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Adler">Doctor Adler</rs> placed his hand on <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s arm reassuringly, and then asked, with some reserve:
          "Well—was it she?"</p>

        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> hesitated for a moment, and then nodded,
          without saying a word. He was hardly aware that by this action he might be guilty of
          untruthfulness. It did not matter to him whether the woman—now lying in the hospital
          morgue—was the same one he had held naked in his arms twenty-four hours before, to the
          wild tunes of Nachtigall's playing. It was immaterial whether this corpse was some other
          unknown woman, a perfect stranger whom he had never seen before. Even if the woman he had
          sought, desired and perhaps loved for an hour were still alive, he knew that the body
          lying in the arched room—in the light of flickering gas-flames, a shadow among shadows,
          dark, without meaning or mystery as the shadows themselves—could only be to him the pale
          corpse of the preceding night, doomed to irrevocable</p>

      </div>
      <div type="chapter" n="7">
        <head>7.</head>
        <p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> hurried home through the dark and empty
          streets. After undressing in the consultation room, as he had done twenty-four hours
          before, he entered the bedroom as silently as possible.</p>

        <p>He heard <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> breathing quietly and
          regularly and saw the outlines of her head on the soft pillow. Unexpectedly, his heart was
          filled with a feeling of tenderness and even of security. He decided to tell her the story
          of the preceding night very soon— perhaps even the next day—but to tell it as though
          everything he had experienced had been a dream. Then, when she had fully realized the
          utter futility of his adventures, he would confess to her that they had been real. Real?
          he asked himself—and at this moment he noticed something dark quite near <rs type="person"
            ref="#Albertina">
            Albertina</rs>'s face. It had definite outlines like the shadowy features of a human
          face, and it was lying on his pillow. For a moment his heart stopped beating, but an
          instant later he saw what it was, and stretching out his hand, picked up the mask he had
          worn the night before. He must have lost it in the morning when making up his bundle, and
          the maid or <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> herself had found it. Undoubtedly <rs
            type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs>, after making this find, suspected
          something—presumably, more and worse things than had actually happened. And she intimated
          this, by placing the mask on the pillow beside her, as though it signified his face, the
          face of her husband who had become an enigma to her. This playful, almost joking action
          seemed to express both a gentle warning and her readiness to forgive. <rs type="person"
            ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> confidently hoped that, remembering her own dream, she
          would not be inclined to take his too seriously, no matter what might have happened. All
          at once, however, he reached the end of his strength. He dropped the mask, uttered a loud
          and painful sob—quite unexpectedly—sank down beside the bed, buried his head in the
          pillows, and wept.</p>

        <p>A few minutes later he felt a soft hand caressing his hair. He looked up and from the
          depths of his heart he cried: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Albertina">"I
            will tell you everything."</said></p>

        <p>She raised her hand, as if to stop him, but he took it and held it, and looked at her
          both
          questioningly
          and beseechingly. She encouraged him with a nod and he began his story.</p>

        <p>The gray dawn was creeping in through the curtains when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">
          Fridolin</rs> finished. <rs type="person" ref="#Albertina">Albertina</rs> hadn't once
          interrupted him with a curious or impatient question. She probably felt that he could not,
          and would not, keep anything from her. She lay there quietly, with her arms folded under
          her head, and remained silent long after <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>
          had finished. He was lying by her side and finally bent over her, and looking into her
          immobile face with the large, bright eyes in which morning seemed to have dawned, he
          asked, in a voice of both doubt and hope: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Albertina">"What shall we do now, Albertina?"</said></p>

        <p>She smiled, and after a minute, replied: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina"
            listener="Fridolin">"I think we ought to be grateful that we have come unharmed
            out of all our adventures, whether they were real or only a dream."</said></p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"Are you quite sure
          of
            that?"</said> he asked.</p>

        <p>
          <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Just as sure as I am
            that the reality of one night, let alone that of a whole lifetime, is not the whole
            truth."</said>
        </p>

        <p><said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" listener="Albertina">"And no dream,"</said>
          he said with a slight sigh, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
            listener="Albertina">"is entirely a dream."</said></p>

        <p>She took his head and pillowed it on her breast. <said aloud="true" direct="true"
            who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"Now I suppose we are awake,"</said> she said,—<said
            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina" listener="Fridolin">"for a long
            time to come."</said></p>

        <p>He was on the point of saying, "Forever," but before he could speak, she laid her finger
          on his lips and whispered, as if to herself: <said aloud="true" direct="true"

            listener="Fridolin">"Never inquire into the future."</said></p>

        <p>So they lay silently, dozing a little, dreamlessly, close to one another—until, as on
          every
          morning at
          seven, there was a knock on the door; and, with the usual noises from the street, a
          victorious ray of light
          through the opening of the curtain, and the clear laughter of a child through the door,
          the
          new day</p>

<div type="chapter" n="5">

	<p>IT was four o'clock in the morning when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> walked up the steps of his home. Before doing
anything else he went into his office and carefully locked the masquerade costume in a closet. As he
wished not to wake Albertina, he took off his shoes and clothes before going into the bedroom, and very
cautiously turned on the light on the little table beside his bed. Albertina was lying there quietly, with
her arms folded under her head. Her lips were half-open, and painful shadows surrounded them. It was a
face that <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> did not know. He bent down over her, and at once her forehead became lined with
furrows, as though someone had touched it, and her features seemed strangely distorted. Suddenly, still
in her sleep, she laughed so shrilly that he became frightened. Involuntarily he called her name. She
laughed again, as if in answer, in a strange, almost uncanny manner. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> called her in a louder voice,
and she opened her eyes, slowly and with difficulty. She stared at him, as though she did not recognize
him.</p>

	<p>"Albertina!" he cried for the third time. As she gained consciousness, an expression of fear, even of
terror came into her eyes. Half awake, and seemingly in despair, she raised her arms.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter?" asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with bated breath. As she still stared at him, terrified, he added,
to reassure her: "It is I, Albertina." She breathed deeply, tried to smile, dropped her arms on the bed
cover and said, in a far away voice: "Is it morning yet?"</p>

	<p>"It will be very soon," replied <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, "it's past four o'clock. I've just come home." She was silent and
he continued: "The Councilor is dead. He was dying when I arrived, and naturally I couldn't—leave
immediately."</p>

	<p>She nodded, but hardly seemed to have heard or understood him. She stared into space, as though
she could see through him. He felt that she must know of his recent experiences—and at the same time
the idea seemed ridiculous. He bent down and touched her forehead. She shuddered slightly.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter?" he asked again.</p>

	<p>She shook her head slowly and he passed his hand gently over her hair. "Albertina, what's the
matter?"</p>

	<p>"I've been dreaming," she said distantly.</p>

	<p>"What have you been dreaming?" he asked mildly.</p>

	<p>"Oh, so much, I can't quite remember."</p>

	<p>"Perhaps if you try?"</p>

	<p>"It was all so confused—and I'm tired. You must be tired, too."</p>

	<p>"Not in the least. I don't think I shall go to bed at all. You know, when I come home so late—it would
really be best to sit right down to my desk—it's just in such morning hours—" He interrupted himself.
"Wouldn't it be better if you told me your dream?" He smiled a little unnaturally.</p>

	<p>She replied: "You really ought to lie down and take a little rest."</p>

	<p>He hesitated a moment, then he did as she suggested and stretched himself beside her, though he was
careful not to touch her. There shall be a sword between us, he thought, remembering a remark he had
once made, half joking, on a similar occasion. They lay there silently with open eyes, and they felt both
their proximity and the distance that separated them. After a while he raised his head on his arm and
looked at her for a long time, as though he could see much more than just the outlines of her face.</p>

	<p>"Your dream!" he hinted, once more. She must just have been waiting for him to speak. She held out
her hand to him, he took it and, more absent-mindedly than tenderly, clasped his hand about her slender
fingers, as he had often done before. She began: "Do you still remember the room in the little villa on
Lake Worther, where I lived with Mother and Father the summer we became engaged?"</p>

	<p>He nodded.</p>

	<p>"Well, it was there the dream began. I was entering this house, like an actress stepping onto the
stage—I don't know where I came from. My parents seemed to have gone on a journey and left me
alone. That surprised me, for our wedding was the next day. But my wedding-dress hadn't yet arrived. I
thought I might be mistaken, and I opened the wardrobe to look. Instead of the wedding dress a great
many other clothes, like fancy dress costumes, were hanging there, opera-like, gorgeous, Oriental. Which
shall I wear for the wedding? I thought. Then the wardrobe was suddenly closed again, or it disappeared,
I don't remember. The room was brightly lighted, but outside the window it was pitch black . . . Suddenly
you were standing out there. Galley slaves had rowed you to the house. I had just seen them
disappearing in the darkness. You were dressed in marvelous gold and silver clothes, and had a dagger in
a silver sheath hanging by your side. You lifted me down from the window. I, too, was gorgeously
dressed, like a princess. We stood outside in the twilight, and a fine gray mist reached up to our ankles.
The country-side was perfectly familiar to us: there was the lake, the mountain rose above us, and I
could even see the villas which stood there like little toy houses. We were floating, no, flying, along
above the mist, and I thought: so this is our honeymoon trip. Soon, however, we stopped flying and were
walking along a forest path, the one leading to Elizabeth Heights. Suddenly, we came into a sort of
clearing in the mountains enclosed on three sides by the forest, while a steep wall of rock towered up in
the back. The sky was blue and starry, with an expanse far greater than it ever has in reality; it was the
ceiling of our bridal-chamber. You took me into your arms and loved me very much."</p>

	<p>"I hope you loved me, too," remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with an invisible, malicious smile.</p>

	<p>"Even more than you did me," replied Albertina seriously, "but, how can I explain it—in spite of the
intensity of our happiness our love was also sad, as if filled with some presentiment of sorrow. Suddenly,
it was morning. The meadow was light and covered with flowers, the forest glistened with dew, and over
the rocky wall the sun sent down quivering rays of light. It was now time to return to the world and go
among people. But something terrible happened: our clothes were gone. I was seized with unheard of
terror and a shame so burning that it almost consumed me. At the same time I was angry with you, as
though you were to blame for the misfortune. This sensation of terror, shame and anger was much more
intense than anything I had ever felt when awake. Conscious of your guilt, you rushed away naked, to go
and get clothes for us. When you had gone I was very gay. I neither felt sorry for you, nor worried about
you. Delighted to be alone, I ran happily about in the meadow singing a tune we had heard at some
dance. My voice had a wonderful ring and I wished that they could hear me down in the city, which I
couldn't see but which nevertheless existed. It was far below me and was surrounded by a high wall, a
very fantastic city which I can't describe. It was not Oriental and not exactly Old-German, and yet it
seemed to be first one, and then the other. At any rate, it was a city buried a long time ago and forever.
Suddenly I was lying in the meadow, stretched out in the sunlight—far more beautiful than I ever was in
reality, and while I lay there, a young man wearing a light-colored fashionable suit of clothes walked out
of the woods. I now realize that he looked like the Dane whom I mentioned yesterday. He walked up and
spoke to me courteously as he passed, but otherwise paid no particular attention to me. He went
straight to the wall of rock and looked it over carefully, as though considering how to master it. At the
same time I could see you hurrying from house to house, from shop to shop in the buried city, now
walking underneath arbors, then passing through a sort of Turkish bazaar. You were buying the most
beautiful things you could find for me: clothes, linen, shoes, and jewelry. And then you put these things
into a little hand-bag of yellow leather that held them all. You were being followed by a crowd of people
whom I could not see, but I heard the sound of their threatening shouts. The Dane, who had stopped
before the wall of rock a little while before, now reappeared from the woods—and apparently in the
meantime he had encircled the whole globe. He looked different, but he was the same, nevertheless. He
stopped before the wall of rock, vanished and came out of the woods again, appearing and disappearing
two, or three, or a hundred times. It was always the same man and yet always different. He spoke to me
every time he passed, and finally stopped in front of me and looked at me searchingly. I laughed
seductively as I have never laughed in my life, and he held out his arms to me. I wished to escape but it
was useless—and he sank down beside me on the meadow."</p>

	<p>She was silent. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s throat was parched. In the darkness of the room he could see she had
concealed her face in her hands.</p>

	<p>"A strange dream," he said, "but surely that isn't the end?" When she said "no," he asked: "Then why
don't you continue?"</p>

	<p>"It's not easy," she began again. "Such things are difficult to express in words. Well, to go on—I
seemed to live through countless days and nights; there was neither time nor space. I was no longer in
the clearing, enclosed by the woods and rock. I was on a flower-covered plain, that stretched into infinite
distance and, finally, into the horizon in all directions. And for a long time I had not been alone with this
one man on the meadow. Whether there were three, .or ten, or a thousand other couples I don't know.
Whether I noticed them or not, whether I was united only with that particular man or also with others, I
can't say. Just as that earlier feeling of terror and shame went beyond anything I have ever felt in the
waking state, so nothing in our conscious existence can be compared with the feeling of release, of
freedom, of happiness, which I now experienced. Yet I didn't for one moment forget you. In fact, I saw
that you had been seized—by soldiers, I think—and there were also priests among them. Somebody, a
gigantic person, tied your hands, and I knew that you were to be executed. I knew it, without feeling any
sympathy for you, and without shuddering. I felt it, but as though I were far removed from you. They led
you into a yard, a sort of castle-yard, and you stood there, naked, with your hands tied behind your back.
Just as I saw you, though I was far away, you could also see me and the man who was holding me in his
arms. All the other couples, too, were visible in this infinite sea of nakedness which foamed about me,
and of which my companion and I were only a wave, so to speak. Then, while you were standing in the
castle-yard, a young woman, with a diadem on her head and wearing a purple cloak, appeared at a high
arched window between red curtains. It was the queen of the country, and she looked down at you with
a stern, questioning look. You were standing alone. All the others stood aside, pressed against the wall,
and I heard them whispering and muttering in a malicious and threatening manner. Then the queen bent
down over the railing. Silence reigned, and she signaled to you, commanding you to come up to her, and
I knew that she had decided to pardon you. But you either didn't notice her, or else you didn't want to.
Suddenly you were standing opposite her, with your hands still tied. You were wrapped in a black cloak,
and you were not in a room, but in the open, somehow, floating, as it were. She held a piece of
parchment in her hand, your death-sentence, which stated your crime and the reasons for your
conviction. She asked you—I couldn't hear the words, but I knew it was so—whether you were willing to
be her lover, for in that case the death-penalty would be remitted. You shook your head, refusing. I
wasn't surprised, for it seemed natural and inevitable that you should be faithful to me, under all
circumstances. The queen shrugged her shoulders, waved her hand, and suddenly you were in a
subterranean cellar, and whips were whizzing down upon you, although I couldn't see the people who
were swinging them. Blood flowed down you in streams. I saw it without feeling cruel, or even surprised.
The queen now moved towards you, her loose hair flowing about her naked body, and held out her
diadem to you with both hands. I realized that she was the girl at the seashore in Denmark, the one you
had once seen nude, in the morning, on the ledge of a bathing-hut. She didn't say a word, but she was
clearly there to learn if you would be her husband and the ruler of the land. When you refused again, she
suddenly disappeared. At the same time I saw them erecting a cross for you—not down in the castle-
yard, but on the meadow, where I was resting with my lover among all the other couples. I saw you
walking alone through ancient streets without a guard, but I knew that your course was marked out for
you and that it was impossible for you to turn aside. Next, you were coming up the forest path, where I
anxiously awaited you, but I did not feel any sympathy for you, though your body was covered with the
weals which had stopped bleeding. You went higher and higher, the path widened, the forest receded on
both sides, and you stood at the edge of the meadow at an enormous, incomprehensible distance. Your
eyes smiled at me as if to show that you had fulfilled my wish and had brought me everything I needed:
clothing and shoes and jewels. But I thought your actions senseless beyond description and I wanted to
make fun of you, to laugh in your face—because you had refused the queen's hand out of faithfulness to
me. And because you had been tortured and now came tottering up here to a horrible death. As I ran to
meet you, you came near more and more quickly. We were floating in the air, and then I lost sight of
you; and I realized we had flown past each other. I hoped that you would, at least, hear my laughter
when they were nailing you to the cross.—And so I laughed, as shrill and loud as I could—that was the
laugh, <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, that you heard—when I awoke." Neither of them spoke or moved. Any remark at this
moment would have seemed futile. The further her story progressed, the more ridiculous and
insignificant did his own experiences become, at least up to date. He swore to himself that he would
resume and conclude all of them. He would then faithfully report them and so take vengeance on this
woman who had revealed herself as faithless, cruel and treacherous, and whom he now believed he
hated more than he had ever loved her.</p>

	<p>He realized that he was still clasping her fingers. Ready as he was to hate her, his feeling of tenderness
for these slender, cool fingers was unchanged except that it was more acute. Involuntarily, in fact against
his will, he gently pressed his lips on this familiar hand before he let it go.</p>

	<p>Albertina still kept her eyes closed and <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought he could see a happy, innocent smile playing
about her mouth. He felt an incomprehensible desire to bend over her and kiss her pale forehead. But he
checked himself. He realized that it was only the natural fatigue of the last few hours which disguised
itself as tenderness in the familiarity of their mutual room.</p>

	<p>But whatever his present state of mind— whatever decisions he might reach in the next few hours, the
urgent demand of the moment was for sleep and forgetfulness. He had been able to sleep long and
dreamlessly the night following the death of his mother, so why not now? He stretched himself out
beside his wife who seemed already asleep. A sword between us, he thought, we are lying here like
mortal enemies. But it was only an illusion.</p>

</div>
<div type="chapter" n="6">
	<head>6.</head>
	<p>AT seven o'clock <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> was awakened by the maid gently knocking on the door, and he cast a quick
glance at Albertina. Sometimes this knocking awakened her too. But today she was sleeping soundly; too
soundly <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought. He dressed himself quickly, intending to see his little daughter before leaving.
The child lay quietly in her white bed, her hands clenched into little fists, as children do in sleep, and he
kissed her on her forehead. Tip-toeing to the door of the bedroom he found Albertina still sleeping
soundly; then he went out. The cassock and pilgrim's hat were safely concealed in his black doctor's bag.
He had drawn up a program for the day with great care, indeed, even a bit pedantically. First of all he
had to see a young attorney in the neighborhood who was seriously ill. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> made a careful
examination and found his condition somewhat improved. He expressed his satisfaction with sincere joy
and ordered an old prescription to be refilled. Then he went to the house in the basement of which
Nachtigall had played the piano the night before. The place was still closed, but the girl at the counter in
the cafe above said that Nachtigall lived in a small hotel in Leopoldstadt. He took a cab and arrived there
a quarter of an hour later. It was a very shabby place, smelling of unaired beds, rancid lard and chicory. A
tough looking concierge, with sly, inflamed eyes, wishing to keep on good terms with the police, willingly
gave information. Herr Nachtigall had arrived in a cab at five o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two
men who had disguised their faces, perhaps intentionally so, with scarfs which they wore wrapped about
their heads and necks. While Nachtigall was in his room, the two men had paid his bill for the last four
weeks. When he didn't appear after half an hour, one of them had gone up to fetch him, whereupon
they all three took a cab to North Station. Nachtigall had seemed highly excited, in fact—well, why not
tell the whole truth to a man who gave one so much confidence—he had tried to slip a letter to the
concierge, but the two men stopped that. Any letters for Herr Nachtigall—so the men had explained—
would be called for by a person properly authorized to do so. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> took his leave. He was glad that he
had his doctor's bag with him when he stepped out of the door, for anyone seeing him would not think
that he was staying at the hotel, but would take him for some official person. There was nothing to be
done about Nachtigall for the time being. They had been extremely cautious, probably with good reason.</p>

	<p>At the costume shop, Herr Gibiser himself opened the door. "I'm bringing back the costume I hired,"
said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, "and would like to pay my bill." The proprietor mentioned a moderate sum, took the money
and made an entry in a large ledger. He looked up, evidently surprised, when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> made no move to
leave.</p>

	<p>"I would also like," said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> in the tone of a police magistrate, "to have a word with you about your
daughter."</p>

	<p>There was a peculiar expression about the nostrils of Herr Gibiser—it was difficult to say whether it
was displeasure, scorn or annoyance.</p>

	<p>"What did you say?" he asked in a perfectly indefinite voice.</p>

	<p>"Yesterday you said," remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, one hand with outstretched fingers resting on the desk, "that
your daughter was not quite normal mentally. The situation in which we discovered her actually
indicates some such thing. And since I took part in it, or was at least a spectator, I would very much like
to advise you to consult a doctor."</p>

	<p>Gibiser surveyed <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> insolently, twirling an unnaturally long pen-holder in his hand.</p>

	<p>"And I suppose the doctor himself would like to take charge of the treatment?"</p>

	<p>"Please don't misunderstand me," replied <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> in a sharp voice.</p>

	<p>At this moment the door which led to the inner rooms was opened, and a young man with an open
top-coat over his evening clothes stepped out. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> decided it could be none other than one of the
vehmic judges of the night before. He undoubtedly came from Pierrette's room. He seemed taken aback
when he caught sight of <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, but he regained his composure at once. He waved his hand to Gibiser,
lighted a cigarette with a match from the desk, and left the apartment.</p>

	<p>"Oh, that's how it is," remarked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> with a contemptuous twitch of his mouth and a bitter taste on
his tongue.</p>

	<p>"What did you say?" asked Gibiser with perfect equanimity.</p>

	<p>"So you have changed your mind about notifying the police," said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> as his eyes wandered
significantly from the entrance door to that of Pierrette.</p>

	<p>"We have come to another agreement," remarked Gibiser coldly, and got up as though this were the
end of an interview. He obligingly opened the door as <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> turned to go and said, without changing
his expression: "If the doctor should want anything again ... it needn't necessarily be a monk's costume."</p>

	<p>Fridolin slammed the door behind him. So that is settled, he thought, as he hurried down the stairs
with a feeling of annoyance which, even to him, seemed exaggerated. The first thing he did on arriving at
the Polyclinic was to telephone home to inquire whether any patients had sent for him, if there was any
mail, or any other news. The maid had scarcely answered him when Albertina herself came to the phone
to answer <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s call. She repeated everything the maid had already told him, and then said casually
that she had just got up and was going to have breakfast with the child. "Give her a kiss for me," said
Fridolin, "and I hope you enjoy your breakfast."</p>

	<p>It had been pleasant to hear her voice but he quickly hung up the receiver. Although he had really
wanted to know what she planned to do during the forenoon, what business was it of his? Down in the
bottom of his heart he was through with her, no matter how their surface life continued. The blond
nurse helped him to take off his coat and handed him his white linen one, smiling at him just as they all
did, whether one paid attention to them or not.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later he was in the ward. The physician in charge had suddenly sent word that he had to
leave the city for a conference, and that the assistants should make the rounds without him. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> felt
almost happy as he walked from bed to bed, followed by the students, making examinations, writing
prescriptions, and having professional conversations with the assistants and nurses. Various changes had
taken place. The journeyman-locksmith, Karl Rodel, had died during the night and the autopsy was to
take place at half past four in the afternoon. A bed had become vacant in the woman's ward, but was
again occupied. The woman in bed seventeen had had to be transferred to the surgical division. Besides
this, there was a lot of personal gossip. The appointment of a man for the ophthalmology division would
be decided day after tomorrow. Hiigelmann, at present professor at the University of Marburg, had the
best chances, although four years ago he had been merely a second assistant to Stellwag. That's quick
promotion, thought <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. I'll never be considered for the headship of a department, if for no other
reason than that I've never been a Dozent. It's too late. But why should it be? I really ought to begin
again to do scientific work or take up more seriously some of the things that I have already started. My
private practice would leave me ample time for it. He asked Doctor Fuchstaler if he would please take
charge of the dispensary. He confessed to himself that he would rather have stayed there than drive out
to Galitzinberg. And yet, he must. He felt obliged, not only for his own sake, to investigate this matter
further, but there were all sorts of other things to be settled that day. He decided to ask Doctor
Fuchstaler to take charge of the afternoon rounds, too, so as to be prepared for all emergencies. The
young girl, over there, with suspected tuberculosis was smiling at him. It was the same one who had
recently pressed her breasts so confidingly against his cheek when he examined her. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> gave her a
cold look and turned away with a frown. They are all alike, he thought bitterly, and Albertina is like the
rest of them —if not the worst. I won't live with her any longer. Things can never be the same again. On
the stairs he spoke to a colleague from the surgical division. Well, how was the woman who had been
transferred during the night getting along? As far as he was concerned, he didn't really think it was
necessary to operate. They would, of course, tell him the result of the histological examination?</p>

	<p>"Why certainly, doctor."</p>

	<p>He took a cab at the corner, consulting his notebook and pretending to the cabman that he was
making up his mind where to go. "To Ottakring" he then said, "take the street going out to Galitzinberg.
I'll tell you where to stop."</p>

	<p>When he was in the cab he suddenly became terribly restless. In fact, he almost had a guilty
conscience, because, during the last few hours, he had nearly forgotten the beautiful woman who had
saved him. Would he now find the house? Well, that shouldn't be particularly difficult. The only question
was what to do when he had found it. Notify the police? That might have disastrous consequences for
the woman who had sacrificed herself for him, or had, at least, been ready to do so. Should he go to a
private detective agency? He thought that would be in rather bad taste and not particularly dignified. But
what else could he possibly do? He hadn't the time or the skill to make the necessary investigations. A
secret club? Well, yes, it certainly was secret, though they seemed to know each other. Were they
aristocrats, or perhaps even members of the court? He thought of certain archdukes who might easily be
capable of such behavior. And what about the women? Probably they were recruited from brothels.
Well, that was not by any means certain, but at any rate, they seemed very attractive. But how about the
woman who had sacrificed herself for him? Sacrificed? Why did he try, again and again, to make himself
believe that it really was a sacrifice? It had been a joke, of course; the whole thing had been a joke and
he ought to be grateful to have gotten out of the scrape so easily. Well, why not? He had preserved his
dignity, and the cavaliers probably realized that he was nobody's fool. And she must have realized it also.
Very likely she had cared more for him than for all those archdukes or whatever they were.</p>

	<p>He got out at the end of Liebhartstal, where the road led sharply up-hill, and took the precaution of
sending the cab away. There were white clouds in the pale-blue sky and the sun shone with the warmth
of spring. He looked back—there was nothing suspicious in sight, no cab, no pedestrian. He walked
slowly up the road. His coat became heavy. He took it off and threw it over his shoulder just as he came
to the spot where he thought the side-street, in which the mysterious house stood, branched off to the
right. He could not go wrong. The street went down-hill but not nearly so steeply as it had seemed
during the night. It was a quiet little street. There were rosebushes carefully covered with straw in a
front garden, and in the next yard stood a baby carriage. A boy in a blue jersey suit was romping about
and a laughing young woman watched him from a ground-floor window. Next came an empty lot, then
an uncultivated fenced-in garden, then a little villa, next a lawn, and finally—there was no doubt about
it—the house he was looking for. It certainly did not seem large or magnificent. It was a one-story villa in
modest Empire style and obviously renovated a comparatively short time before. The green blinds were
down and there was nothing to show that anyone lived there. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> looked around. There was no one
in the street, except farther down where two boys with books under their arms were going in the
opposite direction. He stopped in front of the garden gate. And what was he to do now? Simply walk
back again? That would be too ridiculous, he thought, looking for the bell-button. Supposing someone
answered it, what was he to say? Well, he would simply ask if the pretty country house was to let for the
summer. But the house-door had already opened and an old servant in plain morning livery came out
and slowly walked down the narrow path to the gate. He held a letter in his hand and silently pushed it
through the iron bars to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> whose heart was beating wildly.</p>

	<p>"For me?" he asked, hesitantly. The servant nodded, went back to the house, and the door closed
behind him. What does that mean? <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> asked himself. Can it possibly be from her? Does she, herself,
own the house? He walked back up the street quickly and it was only then that he noticed his name on
the envelope in large, dignified letters. He opened it, unfolded a sheet and read the following:</p>

	<p>Give up your inquiries which are perfectly useless, and consider these words a second warning. We
hope, for your own good, that this will be sufficient.</p>

	<p>This message disappointed him in every respect, but at any rate it was different from what he had
foolishly expected. Nevertheless, the tone of it was strangely reserved, even kindly, and seemed to show
that the people who had sent it by no means felt secure.</p>

	<p>Second warning—? How was that? Oh yes, he had received the first one during the night. But why
second warning—and not the last? Did they want to try his courage once more? Was he to pass a test?
And how did they know his name? Well, that wasn't difficult. They had probably forced Nachtigall to tell.
And besides—he smiled at his absent-mindedness—his monogram and his full address were sewn into
the lining of his fur coat.</p>

	<p>But, though he had made no progress, the letter on the whole reassured him, just why he couldn't say.
At any rate he was convinced that the woman he was so uneasy about was still alive, and that it would
be possible to find her if he went about it cautiously and cleverly.</p>

	<p>He went home, feeling rather tired but with a strange sense of security which somehow seemed
deceptive. Albertina and the child had finished their dinner, but they kept him company while he ate his
meal. There she sat opposite him, the woman who had calmly allowed him to be crucified the preceding
night. She was sitting there with an angelic look, like a good housewife and mother, and to his surprise
he did not hate her. He enjoyed his meal, being in an excited, cheerful mood, and, as he usually did, gave
a very lively account of the little professional incidents of the day. He mentioned especially the gossip
about the doctors, about whom he always kept Albertina well informed. He told her that the
appointment of Hugelmann was as good as settled, and then spoke pf his own determination to take up
scientific work again with greater energy. Albertina knew this mood. She also knew that it usually didn't
last very long and betrayed her doubts by a slight smile. When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> became quite warm on the
subject, she gently smoothed his hair to calm him. He started slightly and turned to the child, so as to
remove his forehead from the embarrassing touch. He took the little girl on his lap and was just
beginning to dance her up and down, when the maid announced that several patients were waiting.
Fridolin rose with a sigh of relief, suggesting to Albertina that she and the child ought to go for a walk on
such a beautiful, sunny afternoon, and went to his consulting room.</p>

	<p>During the next two hours he had to see six old patients and two new ones. In every single case he had
his whole mind on the subject. He made examinations, jotted down notes and wrote prescriptions—and
he was glad that he felt so unusually fresh and clear in mind after spending the last two nights almost
without sleep.</p>

	<p>At the end of his consultation period, he stopped to see his wife and little daughter once more. He
noted with satisfaction that Albertina's mother was with her, and that the child was having a French
lesson with her governess. It was only when he reached the front steps that he realized that all this
order, this regularity, all the security of his existence, was nothing but deception and delusion.</p>

	<p>Although he had excused himself from his afternoon duties at the hospital, he felt irresistibly drawn to
his ward. There were two cases there of special importance to the piece of research he was planning. He
was busy for some time making a more detailed study of them than he had yet done, and following that
he still had to visit a patient in the heart of the city. It was already seven o'clock in the evening when he
stood before the old house in Schreyvogel Strasse. As he looked up at Marianne's window, her image,
which had completely faded from his mind, was revived—more clearly than that of all the others. Well—
there was no chance of failure here. He could begin his work of vengeance without any special exertion
and with little difficulty or danger. What might have deterred others, the betrayal of her fiance, only
made him keener. Yes, to betray, to deceive, to lie, to play a part, before Marianne, before Albertina,
before the good Doctor Roediger, before the whole world. To lead a sort of double life, to be the
capable, reliable physician with a future before him, the upright husband and head of a family. And at
the same time a libertine, a seducer, a cynic who played with people, with men and women, just as the
spirit moved him— that seemed to him, at the time, very delightful. And the most delightful part was
that at some future time, long after Albertina fancied herself secure in the peacefulness of marriage and
of—family life—he would confess to her, with a superior smile, all of his sins, in retribution for the bitter
and shameful things she had committed against him in a dream.</p>

	<p>On the steps he met Doctor Roediger who held out his hand cordially.</p>

	<p>"How is Fraulein Marianne?" asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, "is she a little more composed?"</p>

	<p>Doctor Roediger shrugged his shoulders, "She was prepared for the end long enough, doctor.—Only
when they came this noon to call for the corpse———"</p>

	<p>"So that's already been done?"
  Doctor Roediger nodded. "The funeral will be at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon."</p>

	<p>Fridolin looked down. "I suppose— Fraulein Marianne's relatives are with her?"</p>

	<p>"No," replied Doctor Roediger, "she is alone now. She will be pleased to see you once more, for
tomorrow my mother and I are taking her to Modling." When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> raised his eyes with a politely
questioning look, Doctor Roediger continued: "My parents have a little house out there. Good-bye,
doctor. I still have many things to attend to. It's unbelievable how much trouble is connected with such
a—case. I hope I shall still find you upstairs when I return." And as he said this he reached the street.</p>

	<p>Fridolin hesitated a moment, then slowly went up the stairs. He rang the bell and Marianne herself
opened the door. She was dressed in black and had on a jet necklace which he had never seen before.
Her face became slightly flushed.</p>

	<p>"You made me wait a long time," she said, smiling feebly.</p>

	<p>"Forgive me, Fraulein Marianne, this was a particularly busy day for me."</p>

	<p>They passed through the death-chamber, in which the bed was now empty, into the adjoining room
where, under the picture of the officer in a white uniform, he had, the day before written the death
certificate of the Councilor. A little lamp was burning on the writing desk, and it was nearly dark.
Marianne offered him a seat on the black leather divan and sat down opposite him.</p>

	<p>"I have just met Doctor Roediger. So you are going to the country tomorrow?"</p>

	<p>Marianne seemed little surprised at the cool tone of his question and her shoulders drooped when he
continued almost harshly: "I think that's very sensible." And he explained in a matter-of-fact way what a
favorable effect the good air and the new environment would have on her.</p>

	<p>She sat motionless, and tears streamed down her cheeks. He saw them, feeling impatient rather than
sympathetic. The thought that the next minute, perhaps, she might be lying at his feet, repeating her
confession of the night before, filled him with fear. When she said nothing he got up suddenly. "Much as
I regret it, Fraulein Marianne—" He looked at his watch.</p>

	<p>Still crying, she raised her head and looked at <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. He would gladly have said something kind to
her, but found it difficult to do so.</p>

	<p>"I suppose you will stay in the country for several days," he began rather awkwardly. "I hope you will
write to me ... By the way, Doctor Roediger says the wedding is to be soon. Let me offer you my best
wishes."</p>

	<p>She did not move, as though she had understood neither his congratulations nor his farewell. He held
out his hand but she refused it, and he repeated almost reproachfully: "Well then, I sincerely hope that
you will keep me posted about your health. Good-bye, Fraulein Marianne."</p>

	<p>She sat there as if turned to stone and he left the room, stopping for a second in the doorway, as
though to give her a last opportunity to call him back. But she turned her head away, and he closed the
door behind him. When he was out in the hallway he felt rather remorseful and for a moment he
thought of going back, but he felt that it would have been ridiculous to do so.</p>

	<p>But what was he to do now? Go home? Where else could he go? Anyhow, there was nothing more he
could do today. And what about tomorrow? What could he do and how should he go about it? He felt
awkward and helpless. Everything he put his hands to turned out a failure. Everything seemed unreal: his
home, his wife, his child, his profession, and even he himself, mechanically walking along through the
nocturnal streets with his thoughts roaming through space. The clock on the Rathaus tower struck half
past seven. It didn't matter how late it was; he had more time on his hands than he needed. There was
nothing and no one that interested him, and he pitied himself not a little. Then the idea occurred to him
—not deliberately but as a flash across his mind—to drive to some station, take a train, no matter where,
and to disappear, leaving everyone behind. He could then turn up again, somewhere abroad, and start a
new life, as a different personality. He recalled certain strange pathological cases which he had read in
books on psychiatry, so called double-lives. A man living in normal circumstances suddenly disappeared,
was not heard from, returned months or years later and didn't remember where he had been during this
time. Later, however, someone who had run across him, somewhere, in a foreign country, recognized
him, but the man himself remembered nothing. Such things certainly didn't happen very often, but just
the same they were authentic. Many others probably experienced the same things in a lesser degree. For
instance, when one comes back out of dreams. Of course, one remembers some dreams, but there must
be others one completely forgets, of which nothing remains but a mysterious mood, a curious
numbness. Or one doesn't remember until very much later, and doesn't even then know whether it was
real or only a dream. Only a dream!</p>

	<p>While <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> wandered along, drifting aimlessly towards his home, he entered the neighborhood of
the dark, rather questionable street, where he had accompanied the forlorn little girl to her humble
room less than twenty-four hours before. Why was she "forlorn?" And why was just this street
"questionable?" Isn't it strange how we are misled by words, how we give names to streets, events and
people, and form judgments about them, just because we are too lazy to change our habits? Wasn't this
young girl in reality the most charming, if not actually the purest of all those with whom he had come in
contact during the past night? He felt rather touched when he thought of her, and remembering his plan
of the night before, he turned into the nearest store and bought all kinds of delicacies. Walking along
with his package, the consciousness of performing an act which was at least sensible, and perhaps
actually laudable, made him feel glad. Nevertheless, he turned up his coat collar when he stepped into
the hallway and went upstairs several steps at a time. The bell of the apartment rang with unwelcome
shrillness and he felt relieved when a disreputable looking woman informed him that Fraulein Mizzi was
not at home. But before the woman had an opportunity of taking charge of the package for Mizzi,
another woman joined them. She was still young and not bad-looking, and had on a sort of bath-robe.
"Whom are you looking for?" she said, "Fraulein Mizzi? Well, she won't be home again for some time."</p>

	<p>The older woman made a sign to her to keep quiet, but <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, anxious to confirm what he had
already half guessed asked very simply: "She's in the hospital, isn't she?"</p>

	<p>"Well, as long as you know it anyhow. But there's nothing wrong with me, thank heaven," she
exclaimed vivaciously and stepped quite close to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. Her lips were half open, and as she boldly drew
up her voluptuous body the bath-robe parted. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> declined and said: "I was passing by and I stopped
to bring something for Mizzi." He suddenly felt very young, but asked in a matter-of-fact voice: "In which
ward is she?"</p>

	<p>The younger woman mentioned the name of a professor in whose clinic <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> had been an assistant
several years before, and added good-naturedly: "Just let me have those packages, I'll take them to her
tomorrow. And I promise that I won't snitch any of it. I'll give her your regards too and tell her that
you're still true to her."</p>

	<p>She stepped closer to him and laughed invitingly but when he drew back a little she gave it up at once
and said, as if to console him: "The doctor said she'd be home in six or, at most, eight weeks."</p>

	<p>When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> returned to the street he felt choked with tears. He knew that this was not because he
was deeply affected, but because his nerves were gradually giving way, and he intentionally struck up a
quicker and more lively pace than he was in the mood for. Was this another and final sign that
everything was bound to turn out a failure for him? But why should it? The fact that he had escaped such
a great danger might just as well be a good sign. Was it the all-important thing to escape danger? He
could expect to face many others, as he was by no means ready to give up the search for the marvelous
woman of the night before.</p>

	<p>Of course, it was too late to do anything about it now. Besides, he had to consider carefully just how to
continue the search.</p>

	<p>If only there were someone he could consult in the matter! But he knew of no one to whom he was
willing to confide his adventures of the preceding night. For years he had not exchanged confidences
with anyone except his wife, and of course, he could hardly discuss this case with her. Neither this nor
any other. For, no matter how one looked at it, she had permitted him to be crucified the night before.</p>

	<p>And he suddenly realized why he was walking, not towards his house, but, unconsciously, farther and
farther in the opposite direction. He would not, and could not, face Albertina now. The most sensible
tiling to do was to have supper away from home, then he could go to his ward and look after his two
cases. But under no circumstances would he go home—"home?"—until he could be certain of finding
Albertina asleep.</p>

	<p>He entered a cafe, one of the more quiet and select ones near the Rathaus. He telephoned home not
to expect him for supper, and hung up the receiver quickly so that Albertina wouldn't have a chance to
come to the phone.</p>

	<p>Then he sat down by a window and drew the curtain. A man had just taken a seat in a distant corner.
He wore a dark overcoat and inconspicuous clothes and <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> thought he had seen his face before,
during the day. It might, of course, be just a fancy. He picked up an evening paper, read a few lines here
and there, just as he had done the night before in a different place. Reports on political events, articles
on the theatre, art and literature, accounts of accidents and disasters. In some city that he had never
heard of in the United States a theatre had burned down. Peter Korand, a chimney-sweep, had thrown
himself out of a window. Somehow, it seemed strange to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> that even chimney-sweeps occasionally
commit suicide. Involuntarily he wondered whether the man had first washed himself properly or
whether he had plunged into nothingness just as he was, black and dirty. A woman had taken poison
that morning in a fashionable hotel in the heart of the city. She was an unusually good-looking woman
and had registered there a few days before under the name of Baroness D. At once <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> felt a strange
presentiment. The woman had returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two
men who had left her at the door. Four o'clock! That was exactly the time that he, too, had reached
home. About noontime—the account continued—she had been found unconscious in her bed with every
indication of serious poisoning. . . . An unusually good-looking woman. . . . Well, there were many
unusually good-looking women. . . . There was no reason to believe that Baroness D., or rather the
woman who had registered as such, and a certain other person, were one and the same. And yet—his
heart throbbed and his hand trembled as it held the paper. In a fashionable hotel . . . which one—? Why
so mysterious?—so discreet? . . .</p>

	<p>He put the paper down and at the same time the man in the far corner raised his, a large, illustrated
journal, and held it to shield his face. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> at once picked up his paper again and decided that the
Baroness D. must certainly be the woman he had seen the night before. In a fashionable hotel. . . . There
were not many which would be considered—by a Baroness D. . . . Whatever happened now, this clue had
to be followed up. He called for the waiter, paid his bill and left. At the door he turned to look for the
suspicious character in the corner, but strange to say, he was already gone. . . .</p>

	<p>Serious poisoning. . . . But she was still living. . . . She was living when they found her. There was really
no reason to suppose that she had not been saved. In any case, he would find her—whether she lived or
not. And he would see her—dead or alive. He would see her; no one in the world could stop his seeing
the woman who had died on his account; who had, in fact, died for him. He was the cause of her death—
he alone—if it were she. Yes, it was she. Returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning,
accompanied by two men! Very likely the same men who had taken Nachtigall to the station a few hours
later. This did not seem to point to a very clear conscience.</p>

	<p>He stood in the large Square before the Rathaus and looked around. There were only a few people in
sight and the suspicious looking man from the cafe was not among them. But even if he were—the men
had been afraid—Fridolin had the upper hand. He hurried on, took a cab when he reached the Ring, and
driving first to the Hotel Bristol, asked the concierge, as though he were fully authorized to do so,
whether the Baroness D. who had taken poison that morning, had stopped at this hotel. The concierge
didn't seem at all surprised; perhaps he thought <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> was a police officer or some other official. At
any rate, he replied courteously that the sad case had not occurred there, but in the Hotel Erzherzog
Karl. . . .</p>

	<p>Fridolin at once went there and found that Baroness D. had been taken to the General Hospital
immediately after they found her. He also inquired how they had discovered her attempt at suicide. Why
had they disturbed at noon a lady who had not returned until four in the morning? Well, it was quite
simple; two men (the two men again!) had asked for her at eleven o'clock in the morning. The lady had
not answered her telephone, although they had rung several times, and when the maid knocked on her
door, there was no answer. It was locked on the inside. Finally, they had had to break it open, and they
found the Baroness in her bed, unconscious. They had at once called an ambulance and notified the
police.</p>

	<p>"And the two men?" asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, rather sharply. He felt like a detective.</p>

	<p>Yes, of course the two men looked rather suspicious. In the meantime they had completely
disappeared. Anyhow, it was unlikely that she was really the Baroness Dubieski, the name under which
she had registered. This was the first time she had stopped at the hotel. Besides, there wasn't a family by
that name; at least none belonging to the nobility.</p>

	<p>Fridolin thanked the concierge for the information and left quickly, for one of the hotel managers had
just come up and looked him over with unpleasant curiosity. He got back into the cab and told the
cabman to take him to the hospital. A few minutes later, in the outside office, he learned that the alleged
Baroness Dubieski had been taken to the second clinic for internal medicine. In spite of all the efforts of
the doctors, she had died at five in the afternoon— without having regained consciousness.</p>

	<p>Fridolin breathed a sigh of relief that sounded now like a deep groan. The official on duty looked up,
startled, and <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> pulled himself together and courteously took his leave. A minute later he stood
again out-doors. The hospital park was empty except where a nurse, in her blue and white uniform and
cap, was walking along a near-by path. "She is dead," <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> said to himself.—If it is she. And if it is not?
If she still lives, how can I find her? Only too easily could <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> answer the question as to where at that
moment he could find the body of the unknown woman. As she had died so recently, she was
undoubtedly lying in the hospital morgue, a few hundred paces away. As a doctor, there would, of
course, be no difficulty in gaining admittance there, even at such a late hour. But—what did he want
there? He had never seen her face, only her body. He had only snatched a hasty glance at the former
when he had been driven out. Up to this moment he hadn't thought of that fact. During the time since
he had read the account in the paper he had pictured the suicide, whose face he didn't know, as having
the features of Albertina. In fact, he now shuddered to realize that his wife had constantly been in his
mind's eye as the woman he was seeking. He asked himself again why he really wanted to go to the
morgue. He was sure that if he had met her again alive—whether days or years later, whatever the
circumstances—he would unquestionably have recognized her by her gait, her bearing, and above all by
her voice. But now he was to see only the body again, the dead body of a woman, and a face of which he
remembered only the eyes, now lifeless. Yes—he knew those eyes, and the hair which had suddenly
become untied and had enveloped her naked body as they had driven him from the room. Would that be
enough to tell him if it were unmistakably she?</p>

	<p>With slow and hesitating steps he crossed the familiar courtyards to the Institute of Pathological
Anatomy. Finding the door unlocked, it was unnecessary to ring the bell. The stone floor resounded
under his footsteps as he walked through the dimly lighted hall. A familiar, and to a certain extent
homelike, smell of all kinds of chemicals pervaded the place. He knocked on the door of the Histological
Room where he expected to find some assistant still at work. A rather gruff voice called "Come in."
Fridolin entered the high-ceilinged room which seemed almost festively illuminated. As he half expected,
Doctor Adler, an assistant in the Institute and an old fellow-student of his, was in the center of the room.
He raised his eyes from the microscope and arose from his chair.</p>

	<p>"Oh, it's you," he said to <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, a little annoyed, but also surprised, "to what do I owe the honor of
your visit at such an unaccustomed hour?"</p>

	<p>"Forgive me for disturbing you," said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>. "I see you are just in the midst of some work."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I am," replied Alder in the sharp voice which he retained from his student days. He added in a
lighter tone: "What else could one be doing in these sacred halls at midnight? But, of course, you're not
disturbing me in the least. What can I do for you?"</p>

	<p>When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> did not answer, he continued: "That Addison case you sent down to us today is still lying
over there, lovely and inviolate. Dissection tomorrow morning at eight-thirty."</p>

	<p>With a gesture <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> indicated that that was not the reason of his visit. Doctor Adler went on: "Oh,
then it's the pleural tumor. Well, the histological examination has unmistakably shown sarcoma. So you
needn't worry about that either."</p>

	<p><rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> again shook his head. "My visit has nothing to do with—official matters."</p>

	<p>"Well, so much the better," said Adler. "I was beginning to think that your bad conscience brought you
down here when all good people should be sleeping."</p>

	<p>"It has something to do with a bad conscience, or at least with conscience in general," <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> replied.</p>

	<p>"Oh!"</p>

	<p>"Briefly, and to the point,"—he spoke in a dry, off-hand tone—"I should like to have some information
about a woman who died of morphine poisoning in the second clinic this evening. She is likely to be
down here now, a certain Baroness Dubieski." He continued more hurriedly: "I have a feeling that this so
called Baroness is a person I knew casually years ago, and I am interested to know if I am right——."
"Suicidium?" asked Adler. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> nodded. "Yes, suicide," he translated, as though he wished to restore
the matter to a personal plane.</p>

	<p>Adler jokingly pointed his finger at him. "Was she unhappily in love with your Excellency?"</p>

	<p>Fridolin was a little annoyed and answered, "The suicide of the Baroness Dubieski has nothing
whatever to do with me personally."</p>

	<p>"I beg your pardon, I didn't mean to be indiscreet. We can see for ourselves at once. As far as I know,
no request from the coroner has come tonight. Very likely———"</p>

	<p>Post-mortem examination—flashed across <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s mind. That might easily be the case. Who knows
whether her suicide was in any sense voluntary? He thought again of the two men who had so suddenly
disappeared from the hotel after learning of her attempt at suicide. The affair might still develop into a
criminal case of great importance. And mightn't he—Fridolin—perhaps be summoned as a witness?—In
fact, wasn't it really his duty to report to the police?</p>

	<p>He followed Doctor Adler across the hallway to the door opposite, which was ajar. The bare high room
was dimly lighted by the low, unshaded flames of a two-armed gas-fixture. Less than half of the twelve
or fourteen morgue tables were occupied by corpses. A few bodies were lying there naked. Others were
covered with linen sheets. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> stepped up to the first table by the door and carefully drew back the
covering from the head of the corpse. A glare from Doctor Adler's flashlight suddenly fell upon it and
Fridolin saw the yellow face of a gray-bearded man. He immediately covered it again with the shroud. On
the next table was the naked, emaciated body of a young man, and Doctor Adler called out from farther
down: "Here's a woman between sixty and seventy, so I suppose she isn't the one either."</p>

	<p>Fridolin suddenly felt irresistibly drawn to the end of the room where the sallow body of a woman
faintly glowed in the darkness. The head was hanging to one side and the long dark hair almost touched
the floor. He instinctively stretched out his hand to put the head in its proper position, but feeling a
certain dread which, as a doctor, was otherwise unknown to him he drew back his hand. Doctor Adler
oame up and, pointing to the corpses behind him, remarked : "All those are out of the question, so it's
probably this one?" He pointed his flashlight at the woman's head. Overcoming his dread, <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> raised
it a little with his hands. A white face with halfclosed eyelids stared at him. The lower jaw hung down
limply, the narrow upper lip was drawn up, revealing the bluish gums and a number of white teeth.
Fridolin could not tell whether this face had ever been beautiful, even as lately as the day before. It was
a face without any expression or character. It was dead. It could just as easily have been the face of a
woman of eighteen, as of thirty-eight.</p>

	<p>"Is it she?" asked Doctor Adler.</p>

	<p>Fridolin bent lower, as though he could, with his piercing look, wrest an answer from the rigid
features. Yet at the same time he knew that if it were her face, and her eyes, the eyes that had shone at
him the day before with so much passion, he would not, could not—and in reality did not, want to know.
He gently laid the head back on the table. His eyes followed the moving flashlight, passing along the
dead body. Was it her body?—the wonderful alluring body for which, only yesterday, he had felt such
agonizing desire? <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> touched the forehead, the cheeks, the shoulders and arms of the dead woman,
doing so as if compelled and directed by an invisible power. He twined his fingers about those of the
corpse, and rigid as they were, they seemed to him to make an effort to move, to seize his hand. Indeed,
he almost felt that a vague and distant look from underneath her eyelids was searching his face. He bent
over her, as if magically attracted.</p>

	<p>Suddenly he heard a voice behind him whispering: "What on earth are you doing?"</p>

	<p>Fridolin regained his senses instantly. He freed his fingers from those of the corpse, and taking her thin 
wrists, placed the ice-cold arms alongside of the body very carefully, even a little scrupulously. It seemed
to him that she had just at that moment died. He turned away, directed his steps to the door and across
the resounding hallway back into the room which they had left a little while before. Doctor Adler
followed in silence and locked the door behind them.</p>

	<p>Fridolin stepped up to the wash-basin. "With your permission," he said and carefully washed his hands
with disinfectant. Doctor Adler seemed anxious to continue his interrupted work without further
ceremony. He switched on his microscope lamp, turned the micrometer screw and looked into the
microscope. When <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> went up to him to say good-bye he was already completely absorbed.</p>

	<p>"Would you like to have a look at this preparation?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Why?" asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> absent-mindedly.</p>

	<p>"Well, to quiet your conscience," replied Doctor Adler—as if he assumed that, after all, the purpose of
Fridolin's visit had been a medical-scientific one.</p>

	<p>"Can you make it out?" he asked, as <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> looked into the microscope. "It's a fairly new staining
method."</p>

	<p>Fridolin nodded, without raising his eyes from the glass. "Perfectly ideal," he said, "a colorful picture,
one might say."</p>

	<p>And he inquired about various details of the new technique.</p>

	<p>Doctor Adler gave him the desired explanations. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> told him that the new method would most
probably be very useful to him in some work he was planning for the next few months, and asked
permission to come again to get more information.</p>

	<p>"I'm always at your service," said Doctor Adler. He accompanied <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> over the resounding flagstones 
to the locked outer door, and opened it with his own key.</p>

	<p>"You're not going yet?" asked <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>.</p>

	<p>"Of course not," replied Doctor Adler. "These are the very best hours for work— from about midnight
until morning. Then one is at least fairly certain not to be disturbed."</p>

	<p>"Well"—said <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>, smiling slightly, as if he had a guilty conscience.</p>

	<p>Doctor Adler placed his hand on <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs>'s arm reassuringly, and then asked, with some reserve:
"Well—was it she?"</p>

	<p>Fridolin hesitated for a moment, and then nodded, without saying a word. He was hardly aware that
by this action he might be guilty of untruthfulness. It did not matter to him whether the woman—now
lying in the hospital morgue—was the same one he had held naked in his arms twenty-four hours before,
to the wild tunes of Nachtigall's playing. It was immaterial whether this corpse was some other unknown
woman, a perfect stranger whom he had never seen before. Even if the woman he had sought, desired
and perhaps loved for an hour were still alive, he knew that the body lying in the arched room—in the
light of flickering gas-flames, a shadow among shadows, dark, without meaning or mystery as the
shadows themselves—could only be to him the pale corpse of the preceding night, doomed to
irrevocable</p>

	<p>FRIDOLIN hurried home through the dark and empty streets. After undressing in the consultation
room, as he had done twenty-four hours before, he entered the bedroom as silently as possible.</p>

	<p>He heard Albertina breathing quietly and regularly and saw the outlines of her head on the soft pillow.
Unexpectedly, his heart was filled with a feeling of tenderness and even of security. He decided to tell
her the story of the preceding night very soon— perhaps even the next day—but to tell it as though
everything he had experienced had been a dream. Then, when she had fully realized the utter futility of
his adventures, he would confess to her that they had been real. Real? he asked himself—and at this
moment he noticed something dark quite near Albertina's face. It had definite outlines like the shadowy 
features of a human face, and it was lying on his pillow. For a moment his heart stopped beating, but 
an instant later he saw what it was, and stretching out his hand, picked up the mask he had worn the 
night before. He must have lost it in the morning when making up his bundle, and the maid or Albertina herself had found it. 
Undoubtedly Albertina, after making this find, suspected something—presumably, more and worse things than had
actually happened. And she intimated this, by placing the mask on the pillow beside her, as though it
signified his face, the face of her husband who had become an enigma to her. This playful, almost joking
action seemed to express both a gentle warning and her readiness to forgive. <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> confidently hoped
that, remembering her own dream, she would not be inclined to take his too seriously, no matter what
might have happened. All at once, however, he reached the end of his strength. He dropped the mask,
uttered a loud and painful sob—quite unexpectedly—sank down beside the bed, buried his head in the
pillows, and wept.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later he felt a soft hand caressing his hair. He looked up and from the depths of his
heart he cried: "I will tell you everything."</p>

	<p>She raised her hand, as if to stop him, but he took it and held it, and looked at her both questioningly
and beseechingly. She encouraged him with a nod and he began his story.</p>

	<p>The gray dawn was creeping in through the curtains when <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> finished. Albertina hadn't once
interrupted him with a curious or impatient question. She probably felt that he could not, and would not,
keep anything from her. She lay there quietly, with her arms folded under her head, and remained silent
long after <rs type="person" ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</rs> had finished. He was lying by her side and finally bent over her, and looking into her
immobile face with the large, bright eyes in which morning seemed to have dawned, he asked, in a voice
of both doubt and hope: "What shall we do now, Albertina?"</p>

	<p>She smiled, and after a minute, replied: "I think we ought to be grateful that we have come unharmed
out of all our adventures, whether they were real or only a dream."</p>

	<p>"Are you quite sure of that?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Just as sure as I am that the reality of one night, let alone that of a whole lifetime, is not the whole
truth."</p>

	<p>"And no dream," he said with a slight sigh, "is entirely a dream."</p>

	<p>She took his head and pillowed it on her breast. "Now I suppose we are awake," she said,—"for a long
time to come."</p>

	<p>He was on the point of saying, "Forever," but before he could speak, she laid her finger on his lips and
whispered, as if to herself: "Never inquire into the future."</p>

	<p>So they lay silently, dozing a little, dreamlessly, close to one another—until, as on every morning at
seven, there was a knock on the door; and, with the usual noises from the street, a victorious ray of light
through the opening of the curtain, and the clear laughter of a child through the door, the new day</p>
