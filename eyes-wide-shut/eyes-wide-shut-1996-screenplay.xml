                            two other officers. BILL As a matter of fact, I don't But what about

                        <p>I think it started in my parents house. They weren't there. I was alone.
                            That
                            surprised me because our wedding was the next day and I didn't have a
                            wedding dress.</p>
                        <p>Then you and I were floating above a ancient city. It was a kind of crazy
                            mix
                            of ancient architectural styles. Oriental, Egyptian, Greek and Roman
                            architecture. And it was completely deserted. The streets were empty -
                            no
                            people, no animals. And I remember thinking, so this is our honeymoon.</p>
                        <p>Then it was night and the sky was so full of stars, and so blue and wide
                            it
                            seemed like it was painted. You said it was the ceiling of our bridal
                            chamber and you took me in your arms and made love to me and said you
                            would
                            love me forever.</p>

                        <p>Even more than you did me. We made love and it was wonderful, though
                            there
                            was a sadness to it, and a presentment of sorrow.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly it was morning and we were somewhere in the strange city.</p>
                        <p>We were still completely alone. But something terrible had happened - our
                            clothes were gone. I was terrified as I had never been before, and felt
                            such
                            a burning shame that it almost consumed me.</p>
                        <p>At the same time I was furious with you because I thought it was your
                            fault.
                            And this sensation of terror, shame and fury was more intense than any
                            emotion I had ever felt before.</p>
                        <p>You felt guilty and rushed away naked, to go and get clothes for us.</p>
                        <p>As soon as you were gone I felt wonderful. I neither felt sorry for you,
                            or
                            worried about you. It was heavenly to be alone.</p>
                        <p>I was lying in a lush garden, stretched out naked in the sunlight, and I
                            was
                            far more beautiful than I ever was in reality.</p>
                        <p>And while I lay there, a young man walked out of the woods. He was the
                            young
                            Naval officer I told you about from the hotel. He looked different but I
                            knew it was him. He stopped in front of me and looked at me searchingly.</p>
                        <p>I laughed seductively and wantonly, as I have never laughed in my life,
                            and
                            he held out his arms to me and sank down beside me.</p>

                            love.
                            I seemed to live through countless days and nights -
                            there was neither time nor space. And the more we made love the more our
                            hunger for each other increased.</p>
                        <p>And just as that earlier feeling of terror and shame went beyond anything
                            I
                            had ever felt, so nothing can be compared with the freedom and happiness
                            and
                            the..._desire_ that I now felt.</p>
                        <p>Then I realized there other couples around us - hundreds of them, and
                            they
                            too were making love.</p>
                        <p>Then I was making love to the other men, and as soon as my longing was
                            satisfied with one, I wanted another.</p>
                        <p>I can't say how many I was with. And yet I didn't for one moment forget
                            you.
                            And all this time, you were buying the most beautiful clothes and
                            jewellery
                            you could find for me.</p>
                        <p>Then you were being followed by a crowd of people who were shouting
                            threats.
                            Then you were seized by soldiers, and there were also priests among
                            them.
                            Somebody - a gigantic person, tied your hands. You were still naked.</p>
                        <p>I knew you were going to be crucified but I felt no sympathy for you. I
                            still
                            blamed you for everything that had happened. I felt that I was far
                            removed
                            from you but I knew you could see me naked in the arms of countless men
                            in
                            this sea of nakedness which foamed around me.</p>
                        <p>The soldiers began to whip you and blood flowed down you in streams. I
                            saw it
                            without feeling any surprise or pity.</p>
                        <p>Then you smiled at me as if to show you had fulfilled my wish and bought
                            me
                            everything I wanted. But I thought your actions were ridiculous and I
                            wanted
                            to make fun of you - to laugh in your face.</p>
                        <p>They began to nail you to the cross and I hoped that you would be able to
                            hear my laughter. And so I laughed as shrill and loud as I could... That
                            must have been the laugh that you heard when I woke up.</p>

                            any mail or messages for him would be collected by a person properly

                            might have been nothing more than a charade?... A charade played out for

                            wanted to see you. BILL You say it was a charade but isn't a but
                            strange, a
                            woman offers herself as a sacrifice and the next morning she's dead?</p>

                        <p>That _was_ a coincidence. An amazing coincidence, perhaps but a genuine
                            coincidence, nonetheless. </p>
                        <p>Bill, please believe me, nothing happened to her that hadn't happened
                            before.
                            She got a lot of attention, that was certainly true, but nothing she
                            didn't
                            want. And later, when my people left her at the hotel, they said
                            everything
                            was absolutely okay.</p>
                        <p>What then happened in her room, she did to herself, as she had done many
                            times before. But, sadly, this would be the last time. </p>
                        <p>She OD'd on crack, like the papers said. No chance for foul play. Her
                            door
                            was locked from the _inside_ and the police had to break it down.</p>
                        <p>No, I'm afraid for her it was always going to be just a matter of time -
                            you
                            said as much yourself when she passed out in my bedroom at the Christmas

                        <p>So, Bill, I hope you understand why I thought it was important to tidy
                            this
                            up. But now I think all the dishes are washed and put away. Nobody
                            killed
                            anybody. Someone died. That's sad. But life goes on. It always does.
                            Until
                            it doesn't. Okay?</p>
