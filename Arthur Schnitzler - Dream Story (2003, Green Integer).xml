                        They had decided to attend it just before the end of the <rs type="event"
                            ref="#CARNIVAL"> carnival period </rs> , as their first one of the

                        greeted, like a long lost friend, by <rs type="character" ref="#TWOW"> two
                        women </rs> in red dominoes. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> He </rs>
                        had no idea who they were, although they were unusually well-informed about
                        many affairs of his student days and internship. They had invited him into a
                        box with great friendliness, but had left again with the promise that they
                        would soon return without masks. When they did not appear, he became
                        impatient and went down to the ball-room floor hoping to meet them again,
                        but eagerly as he scanned the room, he could not see them anywhere. Instead,
                        however, another woman unexpectedly took his arm. It was his <rs

                        herself from the company of a <rs type="character" ref="#STRANGER"> stranger </rs>
                        whose blase manner and apparently Polish accent had at first charmed her.
                        Suddenly he had offended her--frightened her by a rather common and
                        impertinent remark. </p>

                        escaped from a disappointingly commonplace masquerade prank, and soon sat
                        like two lovers, among the other couples, in the buffet, eating oysters and
                        drinking champagne. They chatted gaily, as though they had just made each
                        other's acquaintance, acting a comedy of courting, bashful resistance,
                        seduction and surrender. After driving home quickly through the snowy winter
                        night, they sank into each other's arms and were more blissful in their
                        ardent love than they had been for a long time. </p>

                    <p> The gray of morning awakened them only too soon. Fridolin's profession

                            ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> would not stay in bed longer because
                        of her duties as housewife and mother. </p>

                <div type="scene" n="32" xml:id="B5">
                    <p> So the ensuing hours passed, soberly and predetermined, in daily routine and
                        work, and the events of the night before, both those at the beginning and at
                        the end, had faded. </p>
                    <p> But now that the day's work was done‚Äî the child had gone to bed and no
                        disturbance was likely‚Äîthe shadowy forms of the masquerade, the melancholy
                        stranger and the red dominoes, rose again into reality. And all at once
                        those insignificant events were imbued, magically and painfully, with the
                        deceptive glow of neglected opportunities. Harmless but probing questions,
                        and sly, ambiguous answers were exchanged. Neither failed to notice that the
                        other was not absolutely honest, and so they became slightly vindictive.
                        They exaggerated the degree of attraction that their unknown partners at the
                        ball had exerted upon them while each made fun of the other's tendencies to
                        jealousy and denied his own. Soon, their light conversation about the
                        trifling matters of the night before changed into a more serious discussion
                        of those hidden, scarcely suspected wishes, which can produce dangerous
                        whirlpools even in the serenest and purest soul. They spoke of those
                        mysterious regions of which they were hardly conscious but toward which the

                        their dreams. For though they were united in thought and feeling, they knew
                        that the preceding day had not been the first time that the spirit of
                        adventure, freedom and danger had beckoned them. Uneasy, and tormenting

                        from the other. Anxiously, they searched within themselves for some
                        indifferent fact, or trifling experience, which might express the
                        inexpressible, and the honest confession of which might relieve them of the
                        strain and the suspicion which were becoming unbearable. Whether <rs

                        and our eyes met. He didn't smile; in fact, it seemed to me that he scowled.
                        I suppose I did the same, for I was very much stirred. That whole day I lay
                        on the beach, lost in dreams. Had he called me‚ÄîI thought‚ÄîI could not have
                        resisted. I thought I was ready for anything. I had practically resolved to
                        give up you, the child, my future, and at the same time ‚Äîif you can
                        understand it?‚Äîyou were dearer to me than ever. That same afternoon‚Äîsurely
                        you remember‚Äîwe discussed many things very intimately, among others our
                        common future, and our child. At sunset you and I were sitting on the
                        balcony, when, down below on the beach, he passed without looking up. I was
                        extremely thrilled to see him, but I stroked your forehead and kissed your
                        hair, and my love for you was both sorrowful and compassionate. That evening
                        at dinner I wore a white rose and you yourself said I was very beautiful.
                        Perhaps it wasn't mere chance that the stranger and his friends sat near us.
                        He didn't look at me, but I considered getting up, walking over to him and
                        saying: Here I am, my beloved for whom I have waited ‚Äî take me. At that
                        moment the telegram was handed to him. He read it, turned pale, whispered a

                        In the morning, sometimes very early before you got up, I used to stroll
                        along the beach, out beyond the town. Even at that hour the sun was always
                        shining over the sea, bright and strong. Out there on the beach, as you
                        know, were cottages, each one standing like a world in itself. Some had
                        fenced-in gardens, others were surrounded only by the woods. The
                        bathing-huts were separated from the cottages by the road and part of the
                        beach. I hardly ever met people at such an early hour, and bathers were
                        never out. One morning, quite suddenly, I noticed the figure of a woman. She
                        had suddenly appeared on the narrow ledge of a bathing-hut, which rested on
                        piles driven into the sand. She was cautiously advancing, placing one foot
                        before the other, her arms extended backward against the wooden boards. She
                        was quite a <rs type="character" ref="#younggirl"> young girl </rs> ,
                        possibly fifteen years old, with loose blond hair hanging over her shoulders
                        and on one side over her delicate breast. She was looking down into the
                        water and was slowly moving along the wall, her gaze lowered in the
                        direction of the far corner. All at once she stopped opposite me and reached
                        far back with her arms as though trying to secure a firmer hold. Looking up,
                        she suddenly saw me. A tremor passed through her body, as though she wished
                        to drop into the water or run. But as she could move only very slowly on the
                        narrow ledge, she had to stay where she was. She stood there with a face
                        expressing at first fright, then anger, and finally embarrassment. All at
                        once, however, she smiled, smiled marvelously. Her eyes welcomed me,
                        beckoned to me, and at the same time slightly mocked me, as she glanced at
                        the strip of water between us. Then she stretched her young and slender
                        body, glad of her beauty, and proudly and sweetly stirred by my obvious
                        admiration. We stood facing each other for perhaps ten seconds, with
                        half-open lips and dazzled eyes. Involuntarily I stretched out my arms to
                        her; her eyes expressed surrender and joy. Then she shook her head
                        vigorously, took one arm from the wall and commanded me with a gesture to go
                        away. When I didn't at once obey, her childlike eyes turned on me such a
                        beseeching look that there was nothing for me to do but to go, and I went as
                        quickly as possible. I did not look back once‚Äînot because I felt
                        considerate, obedient or chivalrous, but because in her last glance I sensed
                        an emotion so intense, so far beyond anything I had ever experienced, that I
                        was not far from fainting." </said> And he stopped. </p>

                        real experiences, those of his young manhood, many of which she knew about.
                        When they were first married he had yielded, all too readily, to her jealous
                        curiosity and had told her (indeed it often seemed to him) had surrendered
                        to her many secrets which he should rather have kept to himself. He knew
                        that she was inevitably reminded of these affairs and he was hardly
                        surprised when she murmured the half-forgotten name of one of his early
                        sweethearts. It sounded to him a little like a reproach, or was it a covert
                        threat? </p>

                        was a knock on the door. The maid entered and said that the housekeeper from
                        Schreyvogel Strasse had come to fetch the doctor, as the Privy Councilor was
                        very low again. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> went
                        out into the hall, and when the woman told him that the Councilor had had a

                    <p> WHEN <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> reached the
                        street, he unbuttoned his coat. It had suddenly begun to thaw; the snow on
                        the sidewalk was almost gone, and there was a touch of spring in the air. It
                        was less than a quarter of an hour's walk to Schreyvogel Strasse from his
                        home near the General Hospital, and he soon reached the old house. He walked
                        up the dimly lighted winding staircase to the second floor and pulled the
                        bell-rope. But before the old-fashioned bell was heard, he noticed that the
                        door was ajar, and entering through the unlighted foyer into the living room
                        he saw at once that he had come too late. The green-shaded kerosene lamp
                        which was hanging from the low ceiling cast a dim light on the bedspread
                        under which a lean body lay motionless. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
                        Fridolin </rs> knew the old man so well that he seemed to see the face
                        plainly, although it was outside the circle of light‚Äî the high forehead, the
                        thin and lined cheeks, the snow-white beard and also the strikingly ugly
                        ears with coarse, white hairs. At the foot of the bed sat <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> , the Councilor's
                        daughter, completely exhausted, her arms hanging limply from her shoulders.
                        An odor of old furniture, medicine, petroleum and cooking pervaded the room,
                        and in addition to that there was a trace of eau de Cologne and scented
                        soap. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> also noticed the
                        indefinite, sweetish scent of this pale girl who was still young and who had
                        been slowly fading for months and years under the stress of severe household
                        duties, nursing and night watches. When the doctor entered she looked up,
                        but because of the dim light he could not see whether she had blushed, as
                        usual, when he appeared. She started to rise, but he stopped her with a
                        movement of his hand, and so she merely greeted him with a nod, her eyes
                        large and sad. He stepped to the head of the bed and mechanically placed his
                        hands on the forehead of the dead man and on the arms which were lying on
                        the bed-spread in loose and open shirt sleeves. His shoulders drooped with a
                        slight expression of regret. He stuck his hands into the pockets of his coat
                        and his eyes wandered about the room until they finally rested on <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> . Her hair was blond
                        and thick, but dry; her neck well-formed and slender, although a little
                        wrinkled and rather yellow; and her lips were thin and firmly pressed
                        together. <said

                        dear <rs ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> ," </said> he said in a slightly
                        embarrassed whisper, <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"
                            toWhom="Marianne"> "you weren't entirely unprepared for this." </said>
                        She held out her hand to him. He took it sympathetically and inquired about
                        the particulars of the final, fatal attack. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="false" who="Marianne" toWhom="Fridolin"> She reported briefly
                        and to the point, and then spoke of her father's last comparatively easy

                        Drawing up a chair, he sat down opposite her, and tried to console her by <said

                            that her father must have suffered very little at the last. He then

                            any of her relatives had been notified. </said>

                            who="Marianne" toWhom="Fridolin"> "My fiance," </said> she added, and
                        did not look him straight in the eye. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
                        Fridolin </rs> simply nodded. During the year he had met <rs

                        young man‚Äîan instructor in History at the University of Vienna‚Äîwas of an
                        unusually slender build with a short, blond beard and spectacles, and had
                        made quite a good impression upon him, without, however, arousing his
                        interest beyond that. <rs type="character" ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs>
                        would certainly look better, he thought to himself, if she were his
                        mistress. Her hair would be less dry, her lips would be fuller and redder. <said
                            aloud="false" direct="false"
                            who="Fridolin"> I wonder how old she is, he reflected. The first time I
                        attended the Councilor, three or four years ago, she was twentv-three. At
                        that time her mother was still living and she was more cheerful than now.
                            She even took singing lessons for a while. So she is going to marry this
                        instructor! I wonder why? She surely isn't in love with him, and he isn't
                        likely to have much money either. What kind of a marriage will it turn out
                            to be? Probably like a thousand others. But it's none of my business.
                        It's
                            quite possible that I shall never see her again, since there's nothing
                        more
                            for me to do here. Well, many others that I cared for have gone the same
                        way. </said> As these thoughts passed through his mind, <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Marianne">
                            Marianne </rs> began to speak of her father‚Äîwith fervor‚Äîas if his death
                        had suddenly made him a more remarkable person. <said aloud="false"
                            direct="false" who="Fridolin"> Then he was really only fifty-four years
                        old? Well, of course, he had had so many worries and disappointments‚Äîhis

                        Certainly, she had once told the doctor about him. </said> Her brother was
                        now living somewhere abroad. A picture that he had painted when he was
                        fifteen was hanging over there in <rs type="character" ref="#Marianne">
                        Marianne </rs> 's room. It represented an officer galloping down a hill. Her
                        father had always pretended not to see it although it wasn't bad. Oh yes, if
                        he'd had a chance her brother might have made something of himself. <said
                            aloud="false"
                            direct="false" who="Fridolin"> How excitedly she speaks </said> , <rs
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> thought, <said aloud="false"
                            direct="false" who="Fridolin"> and how bright her eyes are! Is it fever?
                        Quite possibly. She's grown much thinner. Probably has tuberculosis. </said>
                        She kept up her stream of talk, but it seemed to him that she didn't quite
                        know what she was saying. It was twelve years since her brother had left
                        home. In fact, she had been a child when he disappeared. They had last heard
                        from him four or five years ago, at Christmas, from a small city in Italy.
                        Strange to say, she had forgotten the name. She continued like this for a
                        while, almost incoherently. Suddenly she stopped and sat there silently, her
                        head resting in her hands. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        was tired and even more bored. He was anxiously waiting for some one to
                        come, her relatives, or her fiance. The silence in the room was oppressive.
                        It seemed to him that the dead man joined in the silence, deliberately and
                        with malicious joy. With a side glance at the corpse, he said: <said

                        that you won't have to stay in this house very much longer." </said> And
                        when she raised her head a little, without, however, looking at <rs
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> , he continued: <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "I suppose your fiance
                        will soon get a professorship. The chances for promotion are more favorable
                        in the Faculty of Philosophy than with us in Medicine." </said> He was
                        thinking that, years ago, he also had aspired to an academic career, but
                        because he wanted a comfortable income, he had finally decided to practice
                        medicine. Suddenly he felt that compared with this noble <rs ref="#Roediger">

                        out of place at the moment. He glanced at the closed window, and without
                        asking for permission but availing himself of his privilege as a doctor, he
                        opened both casements and let some air in. It had become even warmer and
                        more spring-like, and the breeze seemed to bring with it a slight fragrance
                        of the distant awakening woods. When he turned back into the room, he saw <rs
                            type="character"
                            ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> 's eyes fixed upon him with a
                        questioning look. He moved nearer to her and said: <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "I hope the fresh air
                        will be good for you. It has become quite warm, and last night" </said> ‚Äîhe
                        was about to say: we drove home from the masquerade in a snowstorm, but he
                        quickly changed the sentence and continued: <said aloud="true" direct="true"
                            who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "Last night the snow was still lying

                        said. Her eyes became moist, large tears streamed down her cheeks and again
                        she buried her face in her hands. In spite of himself, he placed his hand on
                        her head, caressing it. He could feel her body beginning to tremble, and her
                        sobs which were at first very quiet, gradually became louder and finally
                        quite unrestrained. All at once she slipped down from her chair and lay at <rs

                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> 's feet, clasping his knees with her
                        arms and pressing her face against them. Then she looked up to him with
                        large eyes, wild with grief, and whispered ardently: <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Marianne" toWhom="Fridolin"> "I don't want to leave
                        here. Even if you never return, if I am never to see you again, I want, at
                        least, to live near you." </said> He was touched rather than surprised, for
                        he had always known that she either was, or imagined herself to be, in love
                        with him. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne">
                        "Please‚Äîget up, <rs ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> ," </said> he said
                        softly and bending down he gently raised her. Of course, she is hysterical,
                        he remarked to himself and he glanced at her dead father. <said
                            aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin"> I wonder if he hears

                        everyone in the first hours after passing away, is only in a coma. He put
                        his arms about her in a very hesitating embrace, and almost against his will
                        he kissed her on the forehead, an act that somehow seemed rather ridiculous.
                        He had a fleeting recollection of reading a novel years ago in which a young
                        man, still almost a boy, had been seduced, in fact, practically raped, by
                        the friend of his mother at the latter's deathbed. At the same time he
                        thought of his wife, without knowing why, and he was conscious of some
                        bitterness and a vague animosity against the man with the yellow hand-bag on
                        the hotel stairs in Denmark. He held <rs type="character" ref="#Marianne">
                        Marianne </rs> closer, but without the slightest emotion. The sight of her
                        lustreless, dry hair, the indefinite, sweetish scent of her unaired dress
                        gave him a slight feeling of revulsion. The bell outside rang again, and
                        feeling he was released, he hastily kissed <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> 's hand, as if in gratitude, and went to

                        a dark gray top-coat, an umbrella in his hand and a serious face,
                        appropriate to the occasion. The two men greeted each other much more
                        cordially than was called for by their actual state of acquaintance. Then
                        they stepped into the room. After an embarrassed look at the deceased, <rs

                        out the official death certificate. He turned up the gas-light over the desk
                        and his eyes fell upon the picture of the whiteuniformed officer, galloping
                        down hill, with drawn sabre, to meet an invisible enemy. It hung in a narrow
                        frame of dull gold and rather resembled a modest chromo-lithograph. With his
                        death-certificate filled out, <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        returned to the room where the engaged couple sat, hand in hand, by the bed

                        answer it. While he was gone, <rs type="character" ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs>
                        , with her eyes on the floor, said, almost inaudibly: <said aloud="true"

                        one who has just died. The little room suddenly seemed crowded with
                        mourners. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> felt

                    <p> WHEN <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> stood on the
                        street in front of the house, he looked up at the window which he himself
                        had opened a little while before. The casements were swaying slightly in the
                        wind of early spring, and the people who remained behind them up there, the
                        living as well as the dead, all seemed unreal and phantomlike. He felt as if
                        he had escaped from something, not so much from an adventure, but rather
                        from a melancholy spell the power of which he was trying to break. He felt
                        strangely disinclined to go home. The snow in the streets had melted, except
                        where little heaps of dirty white had been piled up on either side of the
                        curb. The gas-flame in the street lamps flickered and a nearby church bell
                        struck eleven. <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> decided that before going to bed, he
                        would spend a half hour in a quiet nook of a cafe near his residence. As he
                        walked through Rathaus Park he noticed here and there on benches standing in
                        the shadow, that couples were sitting, clasped together, just as if Spring
                        had actually arrived and no danger were lurking in the deceptive, warm air.
                        A tramp in tattered clothes was lying full length on a bench with his hat
                        over his face. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin"> Suppose I
                        wake him and give him some money for a night's lodging </said> , <rs
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> thought. <said aloud="false"
                            direct="false" who="Fridolin"> But what good would that do? Then I would
                        have to provide for the next night, too, or there'd be no sense in it, and
                            in the end I might be suspected of having criminal relations with him. </said>
                        He quickened his steps to escape as rapidly as possible from all
                        responsibility and temptation. <said aloud="false" direct="false"
                            who="Fridolin"> And why only this one? </said> he asked himself. There
                        are thousands of such poor devils in Vienna alone. It's manifestly
                        impossible to help all of them or to worry about all the poor wretches! He
                        was reminded of the dead man he had just left, and shuddered; in fact, he
                        felt slightly nauseated at the thought that decay and decomposition,
                        according to eternal laws, had already begun their work in the lean body
                        under the brown flannel blanket. He was glad that he was still alive, and in
                        all probability these ugly things were still far removed from him. He was,
                        in fact, still in the prime of youth, he had a charming and lovable wife and
                        could have several women in addition, if he happened to want them, although,
                        to be sure, such affairs required more leisure than was his. He then
                        remembered that he would have to be in his ward at the hospital at eight in
                        the morning, visit his private patients from eleven to one, keep office
                        hours from three to five, and that even in the evening he had several
                        appointments to visit patients. Well, he hoped that it would be some time
                        before he would again be called out so late at night. As he crossed Rathaus
                        Square, which had a dull gleam like a brownish pond, and turned homeward, he
                        heard the muffled sound of marching steps in the distance. Then he saw,
                        still quite far away, a small group of fraternity students, six or eight in
                        number, turning a corner and coming towards him. When the light of a street
                        lamp fell upon them he thought he recognized them, with their blue caps, as
                        members of the Alemannia, for although he had never belonged to a
                        fraternity, he had fought a few sabre duels in his time. In thinking of his
                        student days he was reminded again of the <rs type="character" ref="#TWOW">
                        red dominoes </rs> who had lured him into a box at the ball the night before
                        and then had so shamefully deserted him. The students were quite near now;
                        they were laughing and talking loudly. Perhaps one or two of them were from
                        the hospital? But it was impossible to see their faces plainly because of
                        the dim light, and he had to stay quite close to the houses so as not to
                        collide with them. Now they had passed. Only the one in the rear, a tall
                        fellow with open overcoat and a bandage over his left eye, seemed to lag
                        behind, and deliberately bumped into him with his raised elbow. It couldn't
                        have been mere chance. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin">
                        What's got
                            into that fellow? </said>
                        <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        thought, and involuntarily he stopped. The other took two more steps and
                        turned. They looked at each other for a moment with only a short distance
                        separating them. Suddenly <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        turned around again and went on. He heard a short laugh behind him and he
                        longed to challenge the fellow, but he felt his heart beating strangely,
                        just as it had on a previous occasion, twelve or fourteen years before.
                        There had been an unusually loud knock on his door while he had had with him
                        a certain charming young creature who was never tired of prattling about her
                        jealous fiance. As a matter of fact, it was only the postman who had knocked
                        in such a threatening manner. And now he felt his heart beating just as it
                        had at that time. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin"> What's
                        the
                            meaning of this? </said> he asked himself, and he noticed that his knees
                        were shaking a little. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin"> Am
                        I a coward? Oh! nonsense </said> , he reassured himself. <said aloud="false"
                            direct="false" who="Fridolin"> Why should I go and face a drunken
                        student, I, a man of thirty-five, a practising physician, a married man and
                        father of a child? Formal challenge! Seconds! A duel! And perhaps because of
                        such a silly encounter receive a cut in my arm and be unable to perform my
                        professional duties?‚ÄîOr lose an eye?‚ÄîOr even get blood-poisoning?‚ÄîAnd in a
                        week perhaps be in the same position as the man in Schreyvogel Strasse under
                        the brown flannel blanket? Coward‚Äî? </said> He had fought three sabre duels,
                        and had even been ready to fight a duel with pistols, and it wasn't at his
                        request that the matter had been called off. And what about his profession!
                        There were dangers lurking everywhere and at all times‚Äîexcept that one
                        usually forgets about them. Why, how long ago was it that that child with
                        diphtheria had coughed in his face? Only three or four days, that's all.
                        After all, that was much more dangerous than a little fencing match with
                        sabres, and he hadn't given it a second thought. Well, if he ever met that
                        fellow again, the affair could still be straightened out. He was by no means
                        bound by the code of honor to take a silly encounter with a student
                        seriously when on an errand of mercy, to or from a patient. But if, for
                        instance, he should meet the young Dane with whom <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Albertina">
                            Albertina </rs> ‚Äî oh, nonsense, what was he thinking of? Well, after
                        all, it was just as bad as if she had been his mistress. Even worse. Yes,
                        just let that fellow cross his path! What a joy it would be to face him
                        somewhere in a clearing in the woods and aim a pistol at his forehead with
                        its smoothly combed blond hair. He suddenly discovered that he had passed
                        his destination. He was in a narrow street in which only a few
                        doubtful-looking women were strolling about in a pitiful attempt to bag
                        their game. <said

                        he thought. And in retrospect the students, too, with their blue caps,
                        suddenly seemed unreal. The same was true of <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Marianne"> Marianne </rs> , her fiance, her uncle and aunt, all of
                        whom he pictured standing hand in hand around the deathbed of the old <rs

                        another world. Although this idea made him shudder a bit, it also reassured
                        him, for it seemed to free him from all responsibility, and to loosen all
                        the bonds of human relationship. </p>

                        about aimlessly through the dark streets, letting the breeze blow through
                        his hair. Finally, he turned resolutely into a third-rate coffee-house. The

                        old-fashioned, cozy air about it, and was almost empty at this late hour.
                        Three men were playing cards in a corner. The waiter who had been watching

                        street signs with German names had been torn down. There was a conference in
                        Constantinople in which Lord Cranford took part about constructing a railway
                        in Asia Minor. The firm Benies &amp; Weingruber had gone into bankruptcy.

                        his moustache drooped in Polish fashion. He was wearing an open gray

                        white silk tie. His eyelids were inflamed, as if from many sleepless nights,

                            Fridolin </rs> was a regular guest. At intervals, one after another of
                        his more well-todo fellow-students would pay his bill. He sometimes, also,
                        was given clothes, which he accepted gladly and without false pride. He had
                        already learned to play in his home town from a pianist stranded there, and
                        while he was a medical student in Vienna he had studied at the Conservatory
                        where he was considered a talented musician of great promise. But here, too,
                        he was neither serious nor diligent enough to develop his art
                        systematically. He soon became entirely content with the impression he made
                        on his acquaintances, or rather with the pleasure he gave them by his
                        playing. For a while he had a position as pianist in a suburban
                        dancing-school. Fellow-students and table-companions tried to introduce him
                        into fashionable houses in the same capacity, but on such occasions he would
                        play only what suited him and as long as he chose. His conversations with
                        the young girls present were not always harmless, and he drank more than he
                        could carry. Once, playing for a dance in the house of a wealthy banker, he
                        embarrassed several couples with flattering but improper remarks, and ended
                        up by playing a wild cancan and singing a risque song with his powerful,
                        bass voice. The host gave him a severe calling down, but <rs

                        embraced him. The latter was furious and, although himself a Jew, hurled a
                        common insult at him. <rs type="character" ref="#Nachtigall"> Nachtigall </rs>
                        at once retaliated with a powerful box on his ears, and this definitely
                        concluded his career in the fashionable houses of the city. He behaved
                        better, on the whole, in more intimate circles, although sometimes when the
                        hour was late, he had to be put out of the place by force. But the following
                        morning all was forgiven and forgotten. One day, long after his friends had
                        graduated, he disappeared from the city without a word. For a few months he
                        sent post cards from various Russian and Polish cities, and once <rs

                        and red out of the indistinct darkness. A number of little electric bulbs
                        suddenly shone between the open cabinets of a long, narrow passage, the end
                        of which was enveloped in darkness. There were all kinds of costumes hanging
                        to the right and to the left. On one side knights, squires, peasants,
                        hunters, scholars, Orientals and clowns; on the other, ladies-at-court,
                        baronesses, peasant women, lady's maids, queens of the night. The
                        corresponding head-dresses were on a shelf above the costumes. <rs

                        on the box. This business may end badly, thought <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> . At the same time he remembered the
                        fragrance of roses and powder that had arisen from <rs ref="#Pierrette"

                            Fridolin </rs> thought that he now had his bearings. He had sometimes

                        going up. Down to his left he could see the city indistinct in the mist, but
                        glimmering with a thousand lights. He heard the rumbling of wheels behind
                        him and looked out of the window back of him. There were two carriages
                        following his. He was glad of that, for now the driver of the mourning-coach
                        would certainly not be suspicious of him. With a violent jolt, the cab
                        turned into a side street and went down into something like a ravine,
                        between iron fences, stone walls and terraces. <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> realized that it was high time to put
                        on his costume. He took off his fur coat and slipped into the cassock, just
                        as he slipped into the sleeves of his white linen coat every morning in his
                        ward at the hospital. He was relieved to think that, if everything went
                        well, it would be only a few hours before he would be back again by the beds
                        of his patients, ready to give aid. </p>

                    <p> Doors opened before him, and he found himself in a narrow, white vestibule.

                    <p> One of them took his fur coat and disappeared with it into an adjoining

                        Fridolin </rs> entered a dimly lighted room with high ceilings, hung on all
                        sides with black silk. Sixteen to twenty people masked and dressed as monks
                        and nuns were walking up and down. The gently swelling strains of Italian
                        church music came from above. A small group, composed of three nuns and two
                        monks, stood in a corner of the room. They watched him for a second, but
                        turned away again at once, almost deliberately. <rs ref="#Fridolin"

                        wore a hat, took his off and walked up and down as nonchalantly as possible.
                        A monk brushed against him and nodded a greeting, but from behind the mask <rs

                        and penetrating glance. A strange, heavy perfume, as of Southern gardens,
                        scented the room. Again an arm brushed against him, but this time it was
                        that of a nun. Like all the others she had a black veil over her face, head
                        and neck, a blood-red mouth glowed under the black laces of the mask. <said

                        strains of the organ and an Old. Italian sacred aria resounded through the
                        room. They all stood still and listened and <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> surrendered himself for a moment to the

                        pride, were stronger than any of his misgivings. Now that I've gone this
                        far, he thought, <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin"
                            toWhom="Fridolin"> I don't care what happens </said> . And he shook his
                        head negatively without turning around. The voice behind him whispered: <said

                        his own, and he looked away again. The song was now ringing through the
                        room; the organ had a new sound which was anything but sacred. It was
                        worldly, voluptuous, and pealing. </p>

                        from its low and serious pitch to a high and jubilant tone. In place of the
                        organ a piano had suddenly chimed in with its worldly and brazen tunes. <rs

                        before had vanished with a last wild, voluptuous outburst through the
                        ceiling, as it were, into infinity. Doors opened to the right and left On
                        one side <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> recognized the
                        indistinct outlines of <rs ref="#Nachtigall" type="character"> Nachtigall </rs>
                        's figure; the room opposite was radiant with a blaze of light. All the
                        women were standing there motionless. They wore dark veils over their heads,
                        faces and necks and black masks over their eyes, but otherwise they were
                        completely naked. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> 's
                        eyes wandered eagerly from voluptuous to slender bodies, from delicate
                        figures to those luxuriously developed. He realized that each of these women
                        would forever be a mystery, and that the enigma of their large eyes peering
                        at him from beneath the black masks would remain unsolved. The delight of
                        beholding was changed to an almost unbearable agony of desire. And the
                        others seemed to experience a similar sensation. The first gasps of rapture
                        had changed to sighs that held a note very near anguish. A cry broke out
                        somewhere. Suddenly all of them, as though pursued, rushed from the darkened
                        room to the women, who received them with wild and wicked laughter. The men
                        were no longer in cassocks, but dressed as cavaliers, in white, yellow, blue
                        and red. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> was the only
                        one in monk's dress. Somewhat nervously he slunk into the farthest corner,

                        underneath the bandage into the tall mirror opposite. In it the cavaliers

                        In spite of it he meant to dance with her, but at that moment another woman
                        left her partner and walked quickly up to him. He knew at once that it was
                        the same one who had already warned him. She pretended that she had just
                        seen him and whispered, in a voice loud enough to be heard in the other

                        she added: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman" toWhom="Fridolin">
                        "It is really he." </said> The other replied in astonishment: <said

                    <p> One of the cavaliers, the most distinguished looking of them all and the
                        only one dressed in white, suddenly stopped before them. With a slight bow,
                        courteous but imperative, he asked the woman with whom <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> was talking to dance with him. She
                        seemed to hesitate a moment, but he put his arm around her waist and they
                        drifted away to join the other couples in the adjoining room. A sudden
                        feeling of solitude made <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs>
                        shiver as if with cold. He looked about him. Nobody seemed to be paying any
                        attention to him. This was perhaps his last chance to leave with impunity.
                        He didn't know, however, why it was that he remained spell-bound in his
                        corner where he now felt sure that he was not observed. It might be his
                        aversion to an inglorious and perhaps ridiculous retreat, or the
                        excruciating ungratified desire for the beautiful woman whose fragrance was
                        still in his nostrils. Or he may have stayed because he vaguely hoped that
                        all that had happened so far was intended as a test of his courage and that
                        this magnificent woman would be his reward. It was clear at any rate that
                        the strain was too great to be endured, and that, no matter what the danger,
                        he would have to end it. It could hardly cost him his life, no matter what
                        he decided. He might be among fools, or libertines, but certainly not among
                        rascals or criminals. The thought occurred to him to acknowledge himself as
                        an intruder and to place himself at their disposal in chivalrous fashion.
                        This night could only conclude in such a manner,‚Äîwith a harmonious finale,
                        as it were‚Äîif it were to mean more than a wild, shadow-like succession of
                        gloomy and lascivious adventures, all without an end. So, taking a deep
                        breath, he prepared to carry out his plan. At this moment, however, a voice
                        whispered beside him: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="cavalier"

                        shrugged his shoulders. The other walked to the middle of the room and
                        raised his hand. The piano ceased playing and the dance stopped. Two other
                        cavaliers, one in yellow, the other in red, stepped up. <said aloud="true"

                        closed. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> stood alone in
                        the garb of a monk in the midst of the gay-colored cavaliers. <said

                        replied firmly: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"

                        lighted room, naked, with veiled faces, crowding together in a terrified

                        and neck and unwound it with a wonderful circular motion. It sank to the

                        A masked servant brought him his fur coat and helped him put it on. The main

                        hurried out. As he stood on the street the light behind disappeared. The
                        house stood there in silence with closed windows from which not a glimmer
                        issued. I must remember everything clearly, was his main thought; I must

                        surrounded him. The dull reddish glow of a street lamp was visible a slight
                        distance above where the cab was to wait for him. The mourning-coach drove
                        up from the street below, as though he had called it. A servant opened the

                            type="character"> woman </rs> who at this very moment was paying for his
                        safety. It was only too easy to guess the price. But why should she
                        sacrifice herself for him? To sacrifice‚Äî? Was she the kind of woman to whom
                        the things that were facing her, that she was now submitting to, could mean
                        a sacrifice? If she attended these affairs‚Äîand since she seemed to
                        understand the rules so well it could not be her first time‚Äîwhat difference
                        could it make to her if she belonged to one of the cavaliers, or to all?
                        Indeed, could she possibly be anything but a woman of easy virtue? Were any
                        of them anything else? That's what they were, without a doubt, even if all
                        of them led another, more normal life, so to speak, besides this one of
                        promiscuity. Perhaps everything he had just gone through had been only an
                        outrageous joke. A joke planned, prepared and even rehearsed for such an
                        occasion when some bold outsider should be caught intruding? And yet, as he
                        thought of the <rs ref="woman" type="character"> woman </rs> who had warned
                        him from the very beginning, who was now ready to pay for him‚Äîhe remembered
                        something in her voice, her bearing, in the royal nobility of her nude body
                        which could not possibly have been false. Or was it possible that only his
                        sudden appearance had caused her to change? After everything that had
                        happened, such a supposition did not seem impossible. There was no conceit
                        in this idea. There may be hours or nights, he thought, in which some
                        strange, irresistible charm emanates from men who under normal circumstances
                        have no special power over the other sex. The carriage continued up-hill. If
                        all were well, he should have turned into the main street long ago. What
                        were they going to do with him? Where was the carriage taking him? Was the
                        comedy to be continued elsewhere? And what would the continuation be? A
                        solution of the mystery and a happy reunion at some other place. Would he be
                        rewarded for passing the test so creditably and made a member of the secret
                        society? Was he to have unchallenged possession of the lovely nun? </p>
                    <p> The windows of the carriage were closed and <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> tried to look out‚Äîbut they were opaque.
                        He attempted to open them, first on one side, then on the other, but it was
                        impossible. The glass partition between him and the coachman's box was just
                        as thick and just as firmly closed. He knocked on the glass, he called, he
                        shouted, but the carriage went on. He tried to open both the doors, but they
                        wouldn't budge. His renewed calling was drowned by the rattling of the
                        wheels and the roaring of the wind. The carriage began to jolt, going
                        down-hill, faster and faster. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs>
                        , uneasy and alarmed, was on the point of smashing one of the blind windows,
                        when the carriage suddenly stopped. Both doors opened together, as if by
                        some mechanism, and as though <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs>
                        had been ironically given the choice between one side or the other. He
                        jumped out, the doors closed with a bang‚Äîand without the coachman paying the
                        slightest attention to him, the carriage drove away across the open field
                        into the darkness of the night. The sky was overcast, clouds raced across
                        it, and the wind whistled. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs>
                        stood in the snow which shed a faint light round about. He was alone, his
                        open fur coat over his monk's costume, the pilgrim's hat on his head; and an
                        uncanny feeling overcame him. The main street was a slight distance away,
                        where a row of dimly-flickering street lamps indicated the direction of the
                        city. However, he ran straight down across the sloping, snow-covered field,
                        which shortened the way, so as to get among people as quickly as possible.
                        His feet soaked, he came into a narrow, almost unlighted street, and at
                        first walked along between high board fences which groaned in the wind.
                        Turning the next corner, he reached a somewhat wider street, where scattered
                        little houses alternated with empty building lots. Somewhere a tower clock
                        struck three. </p>
                    <p> Someone was coming towards him. The person wore a short jacket, he had his
                        hands in his trouser pockets, his head was down between his shoulders, and
                        his hat was pulled over his forehead. <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character">
                        Fridolin </rs> got ready for an attack, but the tramp unexpectedly turned
                        and ran. <said aloud="false" direct="false" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Fridolin">
                        What does that mean? </said> he asked himself. Then he decided that he must
                        present a very uncanny appearance, took off the pilgrim's hat and buttoned
                        his coat, underneath which the monk's gown was flapping around his ankles.
                        Again he turned a corner into a suburban main street. A man in peasant's
                        dress walked past and spoke to him, thinking him a priest. The light of a
                        street lamp fell upon a sign on a corner house. Liebhartstal‚Äîthen he wasn't
                        very far from the house which he had left less than an hour before. For a
                        second he felt tempted to retrace his steps and to wait in the vicinity for
                        further developments. But he gave up the idea when he realized that he would
                        only expose himself to grave danger without solving the mystery. As he
                        imagined what was probably taking place in the villa at this very moment he
                        was filled with wrath, despair, shame and fear. This state of mind was so
                        unbearable that it almost made him sorry the tramp had not attacked him; in
                        fact, he almost regretted that he wasn't lying against the fence in the
                        deserted street with a knife-gash in his side. That, at least, might have
                        given some significance to this senseless night with its childish
                        adventures, all of which had been so ruthlessly cut short. It seemed
                        positively ridiculous to return home, as he now intended doing. But nothing
                        was lost as yet. There was another day ahead, and he swore that he would not
                        rest until he had found again the beautiful <rs ref="woman" type="character">
                        woman </rs> whose dazzling nakedness had so intoxicated him. It was only now
                        that he thought of <rs ref="Albertina" type="character"> Albertina </rs> ,
                        but with a feeling that she, too, would first have to be won. He could not,
                        must not, be reunited with her until he had deceived her with all the other
                        women of the night. With the naked <rs ref="woman" type="character"> woman </rs>
                        , with <rs ref="Pierrette" type="character"> Pierrette </rs> , with <rs
                            ref="Marianne" type="character"> Marianne </rs> , with <rs ref="Mizzi"
                            type="character"> Mizzi </rs> in the narrow street. And shouldn't he
                        also try to find the insolent student who had bumped into him, so that he
                        might challenge him to a duel with sabres or, better still, with pistols?
                        What did someone else's life, what did his own, matter to him? Is one always
                        to stake one's life just from a sense of duty or self-sacrifice, and never
                        because of a whim or a passion, or simply to match oneself against Fate?
                        Again the thought came to him that even now the germ of a fatal disease
                        might be in his body. Wouldn't it be silly to die just because a child with
                        diphtheria had coughed in his face? Perhaps he was already ill. Wasn't he
                        feverish? Perhaps at this moment he was lying at home in bed‚Äîand everything
                        he thought he had experienced was merely delirium? </p>
                    <p>
                        <rs ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> opened his eyes as wide
                        as possible, passed his hand over his forehead and cheeks and felt his
                        pulse. It scarcely beat faster. Everything was all right. He was completely
                        awake. He continued along the street, towards the city. A few market-wagons
                        rumbled by, and now and then he met poorly dressed people whose day was just
                        beginning. Behind the window of a coffee-house, at a table over which a
                        gas-flame flickered, sat a fat man with a scarf around his neck, his head on
                        his hands, fast asleep. The houses were still enveloped in darkness, though
                        here and there a few windows were lighted and <rs ref="#Fridolin"
                            type="character"> Fridolin </rs> thought he could feel the people
                        gradually awaking. It seemed that he could see them stretching themselves in
                        their beds and preparing for their pitiful and strenuous day. A new day
                        faced him, too, but for him it wasn't pitiful and dull. And with a strange,
                        happy beating of his heart, he realized that in a few hours he would be
                        walking around between the beds of his patients in his white hospital coat.
                        A one-horse cab stood at the next corner, the coachman asleep on the box. <rs
                            ref="#Fridolin" type="character"> Fridolin </rs> awakened him, gave his

                    <p> IT was four o'clock in the morning when <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
                        Fridolin </rs> walked up the steps of his home. Before doing anything else
                        he went into his office and carefully locked the masquerade costume in a
                        closet. As he wished not to wake <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina">
                        Albertina </rs> , he took off his shoes and clothes before going into the
                        bedroom, and very cautiously turned on the light on the little table beside
                        his bed. <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> was lying
                        there quietly, with her arms folded under her head. Her lips were half-open,
                        and painful shadows surrounded them. It was a face that <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> did not know. He bent down over her, and
                        at once her forehead became lined with furrows, as though someone had
                        touched it, and her features seemed strangely distorted. Suddenly, still in
                        her sleep, she laughed so shrilly that he became frightened. Involuntarily
                        he called her name. She laughed again, as if in answer, in a strange, almost
                        uncanny manner. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> called
                        her in a louder voice, and she opened her eyes, slowly and with difficulty.
                        She stared at him, as though she did not recognize him. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Albertina"> "Albertina!" </said> he
                        cried for the third time. As she gained consciousness, an expression of
                        fear, even of terror came into her eyes. Half awake, and seemingly in
                        despair, she raised her arms. <said aloud="true" direct="true"
                            who="Fridolin" toWhom="Albertina"> "What's the matter?" </said> asked <rs

                        she still stared at him, terrified, he added, to reassure her: <said

                        seemed to have heard or understood him. She stared into space, as though she
                        could see through him. He felt that she must know of his recent
                        experiences‚Äîand at the same time the idea seemed ridiculous. He bent down
                        and touched her forehead. She shuddered slightly. <said aloud="true"

                        he asked again. She shook her head slowly and he passed his hand gently over

                        "You really ought to lie down and take a little rest." </said> He hesitated
                        a moment, then he did as she suggested and stretched himself beside her,
                        though he was careful not to touch her. There shall be a sword between us,
                        he thought, remembering a remark he had once made, half joking, on a similar
                        occasion. They lay there silently with open eyes, and they felt both their
                        proximity and the distance that separated them. After a while he raised his
                        head on his arm and looked at her for a long time, as though he could see
                        much more than just the outlines of her face. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Albertina"> "Your dream!" </said>
                        he hinted, once more. She must just have been waiting for him to speak. She
                        held out her hand to him, he took it and, more absent-mindedly than
                        tenderly, clasped his hand about her slender fingers, as he had often done
                        before. She began: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Albertina"
                            toWhom="Fridolin"> "Do you still remember the room in the little villa
                            on Lake Worther, where I lived with Mother and Father the summer we
                        became
                            engaged?" </said> He nodded. <said aloud="true" direct="true"
                            who="Albertina" toWhom="Fridolin"> "Well, it was there the dream began.
                            I was entering this house, like an actress stepping onto the stage‚ÄîI
                        don't
                            know where I came from. My parents seemed to have gone on a journey and
                        left
                            me alone. That surprised me, for our wedding was the next day. But my
                        wedding-dress hadn't yet arrived. I thought I might be mistaken, and I
                            opened the wardrobe to look. Instead of the wedding dress a great many
                        other
                            clothes, like fancy dress costumes, were hanging there, opera-like,
                        gorgeous, Oriental. Which shall I wear for the wedding? I thought. Then the
                        wardrobe was suddenly closed again, or it disappeared, I don't remember. The
                        room was brightly lighted, but outside the window it was pitch black . . .
                        Suddenly you were standing out there. Galley slaves had rowed you to the
                        house. I had just seen them disappearing in the darkness. You were dressed
                            in marvelous gold and silver clothes, and had a dagger in a silver
                            sheath
                            hanging by your side. You lifted me down from the window. I, too, was
                        gorgeously dressed, like a princess. We stood outside in the twilight, and a
                        fine gray mist reached up to our ankles. The country-side was perfectly
                        familiar to us: there was the lake, the mountain rose above us, and I could
                        even see the villas which stood there like little toy houses. We were
                        floating, no, flying, along above the mist, and I thought: so this is our
                        honeymoon trip. Soon, however, we stopped flying and were walking along a
                        forest path, the one leading to Elizabeth Heights. Suddenly, we came into a
                        sort of clearing in the mountains enclosed on three sides by the forest,
                        while a steep wall of rock towered up in the back. The sky was blue and
                        starry, with an expanse far greater than it ever has in reality; it was the
                        ceiling of our bridal-chamber. You took me into your arms and loved me very
                        much." </said>

                        can I explain it‚Äîin spite of the intensity of our happiness our love was
                            also sad, as if filled with some presentiment of sorrow. Suddenly, it
                            was
                            morning. The meadow was light and covered with flowers, the forest
                        glistened
                            with dew, and over the rocky wall the sun sent down quivering rays of
                        light.
                            It was now time to return to the world and go among people. But
                            something
                            terrible happened: our clothes were gone. I was seized with unheard of
                        terror and a shame so burning that it almost consumed me. At the same time I
                        was angry with you, as though you were to blame for the misfortune. This
                        sensation of terror, shame and anger was much more intense than anything I
                        had ever felt when awake. Conscious of your guilt, you rushed away naked, to
                        go and get clothes for us. When you had gone I was very gay. I neither felt
                        sorry for you, nor worried about you. Delighted to be alone, I ran happily
                        about in the meadow singing a tune we had heard at some dance. My voice had
                            a wonderful ring and I wished that they could hear me down in the city,
                        which I couldn't see but which nevertheless existed. It was far below me and
                        was surrounded by a high wall, a very fantastic city which I can't describe.
                        It was not Oriental and not exactly Old-German, and yet it seemed to be
                            first one, and then the other. At any rate, it was a city buried a long
                        time
                            ago and forever. Suddenly I was lying in the meadow, stretched out in
                            the
                            sunlight‚Äîfar more beautiful than I ever was in reality, and while I lay
                        there, a young man wearing a light-colored fashionable suit of clothes
                            walked out of the woods. I now realize that he looked like the Dane whom
                        I
                            mentioned yesterday. He walked up and spoke to me courteously as he
                        passed,
                            but otherwise paid no particular attention to me. He went straight to
                            the
                            wall of rock and looked it over carefully, as though considering how to
                        master it. At the same time I could see you hurrying from house to house,
                        from shop to shop in the buried city, now walking underneath arbors, then
                        passing through a sort of Turkish bazaar. You were buying the most beautiful
                        things you could find for me: clothes, linen, shoes, and jewelry. And then
                        you put these things into a little hand-bag of yellow leather that held them
                        all. You were being followed by a crowd of people whom I could not see, but
                            I heard the sound of their threatening shouts. The Dane, who had stopped
                        before the wall of rock a little while before, now reappeared from the
                        woods‚Äîand apparently in the meantime he had encircled the whole globe. He
                        looked different, but he was the same, nevertheless. He stopped before the
                        wall of rock, vanished and came out of the woods again, appearing and
                        disappearing two, or three, or a hundred times. It was always the same man
                        and yet always different. He spoke to me every time he passed, and finally
                        stopped in front of me and looked at me searchingly. I laughed seductively
                            as I have never laughed in my life, and he held out his arms to me. I
                        wished
                            to escape but it was useless‚Äîand he sank down beside me on the meadow." </said>

                        throat was parched. In the darkness of the room he could see she had

                        things are difficult to express in words. Well, to go on‚ÄîI seemed to live
                        through countless days and nights; there was neither time nor space. I was
                            no longer in the clearing, enclosed by the woods and rock. I was on a
                        flower-covered plain, that stretched into infinite distance and, finally,
                        into the horizon in all directions. And for a long time I had not been alone
                        with this one man on the meadow. Whether there were three, .or ten, or a
                        thousand other couples I don't know. Whether I noticed them or not, whether
                            I was united only with that particular man or also with others, I can't
                        say.
                            Just as that earlier feeling of terror and shame went beyond anything I
                        have
                            ever felt in the waking state, so nothing in our conscious existence can
                        be
                            compared with the feeling of release, of freedom, of happiness, which I
                        now
                            experienced. Yet I didn't for one moment forget you. In fact, I saw that
                        you
                            had been seized‚Äîby soldiers, I think‚Äîand there were also priests among
                        them.
                            Somebody, a gigantic person, tied your hands, and I knew that you were
                            to be
                            executed. I knew it, without feeling any sympathy for you, and without
                        shuddering. I felt it, but as though I were far removed from you. They led
                        you into a yard, a sort of castle-yard, and you stood there, naked, with
                            your hands tied behind your back. Just as I saw you, though I was far
                        away,
                            you could also see me and the man who was holding me in his arms. All
                            the
                            other couples, too, were visible in this infinite sea of nakedness which
                        foamed about me, and of which my companion and I were only a wave, so to
                        speak. Then, while you were standing in the castle-yard, a young woman, with
                        a diadem on her head and wearing a purple cloak, appeared at a high arched
                        window between red curtains. It was the queen of the country, and she looked
                        down at you with a stern, questioning look. You were standing alone. All the
                        others stood aside, pressed against the wall, and I heard them whispering
                            and muttering in a malicious and threatening manner. Then the queen bent
                        down over the railing. Silence reigned, and she signaled to you, commanding
                        you to come up to her, and I knew that she had decided to pardon you. But
                            you either didn't notice her, or else you didn't want to. Suddenly you
                        were
                            standing opposite her, with your hands still tied. You were wrapped in a
                        black cloak, and you were not in a room, but in the open, somehow, floating,
                        as it were. She held a piece of parchment in her hand, your death-sentence,
                        which stated your crime and the reasons for your conviction. She asked you‚ÄîI
                        couldn't hear the words, but I knew it was so‚Äîwhether you were willing to be
                        her lover, for in that case the death-penalty would be remitted. You shook
                        your head, refusing. I wasn't surprised, for it seemed natural and
                            inevitable that you should be faithful to me, under all circumstances.
                        The
                            queen shrugged her shoulders, waved her hand, and suddenly you were in a
                        subterranean cellar, and whips were whizzing down upon you, although I
                        couldn't see the people who were swinging them. Blood flowed down you in
                        streams. I saw it without feeling cruel, or even surprised. The queen now
                        moved towards you, her loose hair flowing about her naked body, and held out
                        her diadem to you with both hands. I realized that she was the girl at the
                        seashore in Denmark, the one you had once seen nude, in the morning, on the
                        ledge of a bathing-hut. She didn't say a word, but she was clearly there to
                        learn if you would be her husband and the ruler of the land. When you
                            refused again, she suddenly disappeared. At the same time I saw them
                        erecting a cross for you‚Äînot down in the castle- yard, but on the meadow,
                        where I was resting with my lover among all the other couples. I saw you
                        walking alone through ancient streets without a guard, but I knew that your
                        course was marked out for you and that it was impossible for you to turn
                        aside. Next, you were coming up the forest path, where I anxiously awaited
                        you, but I did not feel any sympathy for you, though your body was covered
                        with the weals which had stopped bleeding. You went higher and higher, the
                        path widened, the forest receded on both sides, and you stood at the edge of
                        the meadow at an enormous, incomprehensible distance. Your eyes smiled at me
                        as if to show that you had fulfilled my wish and had brought me everything I
                        needed: clothing and shoes and jewels. But I thought your actions senseless
                        beyond description and I wanted to make fun of you, to laugh in your
                        face‚Äîbecause you had refused the queen's hand out of faithfulness to me. And
                        because you had been tortured and now came tottering up here to a horrible
                        death. As I ran to meet you, you came near more and more quickly. We were
                        floating in the air, and then I lost sight of you; and I realized we had
                        flown past each other. I hoped that you would, at least, hear my laughter
                        when they were nailing you to the cross.‚ÄîAnd so I laughed, as shrill and
                            loud as I could‚Äîthat was the laugh, Fridolin, that you heard‚Äîwhen I
                        awoke." </said> Neither of them spoke or moved. Any remark at this moment
                        would have seemed futile. The further her story progressed, the more
                        ridiculous and insignificant did his own experiences become, at least up to
                        date. He swore to himself that he would resume and conclude all of them. He
                        would then faithfully report them and so take vengeance on this woman who
                        had revealed herself as faithless, cruel and treacherous, and whom he now
                        believed he hated more than he had ever loved her.He realized that he was
                        still clasping her fingers. Ready as he was to hate her, his feeling of
                        tenderness for these slender, cool fingers was unchanged except that it was
                        more acute. Involuntarily, in fact against his will, he gently pressed his
                        lips on this familiar hand before he let it go. <rs type="character"

                        smile playing about her mouth. He felt an incomprehensible desire to bend
                        over her and kiss her pale forehead. But he checked himself. He realized
                        that it was only the natural fatigue of the last few hours which disguised
                        itself as tenderness in the familiarity of their mutual room.But whatever

                        hours, the urgent demand of the moment was for sleep and forgetfulness. He
                        had been able to sleep long and dreamlessly the night following the death of
                        his <rs type="character" ref="#FridolinMother"> mother </rs> , so why not
                        now? He stretched himself out beside his wife who seemed already asleep. A
                        sword between us, he thought, we are lying here like mortal enemies. But it
                        was only an illusion. </p>

                        awakened by the maid gently knocking on the door, and he cast a quick glance
                        at <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> . Sometimes this
                        knocking awakened her too. But today she was sleeping soundly; too soundly <rs

                        himself quickly, intending to see his little daughter before leaving. The
                        child lay quietly in her white bed, her hands clenched into little fists, as
                        children do in sleep, and he kissed her on her forehead. Tip-toeing to the
                        door of the bedroom he found <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina">
                            Albertina </rs> still sleeping soundly; then he went out. The cassock
                        and pilgrim's hat were safely concealed in his black doctor's bag. He had
                        drawn up a program for the day with great care, indeed, even a bit
                        pedantically. First of all he had to see a young attorney in the
                        neighborhood who was seriously ill. <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> made a careful
                        examination and found his condition somewhat improved. He expressed his
                        satisfaction with sincere joy and ordered an old prescription to be
                        refilled. Then he went to the house in the basement of which Nachtigall had
                        played the piano the night before. The place was still closed, but the girl
                        at the counter in the cafe above said that <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Nachtigall"> Nachtigall </rs> lived in a small hotel in
                        Leopoldstadt. He took a cab and arrived there a quarter of an hour later. It
                        was a very shabby place, smelling of unaired beds, rancid lard and chicory.
                        A tough looking concierge, with sly, inflamed eyes, wishing to keep on good
                        terms with the police, willingly gave information. <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Nachtigall"> Herr Nachtigall </rs> had arrived in a cab at five
                        o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men who had disguised their

                        their heads and necks. While <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Nachtigall"> Nachtigall </rs> was in his room, the two men had
                        paid his bill for the last four weeks. When he didn't appear after half an

                        would take him for some official person. There was nothing to be done about <rs

                        everything the maid had already told him, and then said casually that she

                        It had been pleasant to hear her voice but he quickly hung up the receiver.
                        Although he had really wanted to know what she planned to do during the
                        forenoon, what business was it of his? Down in the bottom of his heart he
                        was through with her, no matter how their surface life continued. The blond
                        nurse helped him to take off his coat and handed him his white linen one,
                        smiling at him just as they all did, whether one paid attention to them or
                        not. </p>
                    <p> A few minutes later he was in the ward. The physician in charge had suddenly
                        sent word that he had to leave the city for a conference, and that the
                        assistants should make the rounds without him. <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> felt almost happy as he walked from bed
                        to bed, followed by the students, making examinations, writing
                        prescriptions, and having professional conversations with the assistants and
                        nurses. Various changes had taken place. The journeyman-locksmith, Karl
                        Rodel, had died during the night and the autopsy was to take place at half
                        past four in the afternoon. A bed had become vacant in the woman's ward, but
                        was again occupied. The woman in bed seventeen had had to be transferred to
                        the surgical division. Besides this, there was a lot of personal gossip. The
                        appointment of a man for the ophthalmology division would be decided day
                        after tomorrow. Hiigelmann, at present professor at the University of
                        Marburg, had the best chances, although four years ago he had been merely a
                        second assistant to Stellwag. That's quick promotion, thought <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> . I'll never be
                        considered for the headship of a department, if for no other reason than
                        that I've never been a Dozent. It's too late. But why should it be? I really
                        ought to begin again to do scientific work or take up more seriously some of
                        the things that I have already started. My private practice would leave me
                        ample time for it. He asked <rs type="character" ref="#Fuchstaler"> Doctor
                        Fuchstaler </rs> if he would please take charge of the dispensary. He
                        confessed to himself that he would rather have stayed there than drive out
                        to Galitzinberg. And yet, he must. He felt obliged, not only for his own
                        sake, to investigate this matter further, but there were all sorts of other
                        things to be settled that day. He decided to ask <rs type="character"

                        be prepared for all emergencies. The young girl, over there, with suspected
                        tuberculosis was smiling at him. It was the same one who had recently
                        pressed her breasts so confidingly against his cheek when he examined her. <rs

                        and turned away with a frown. They are all alike, he thought bitterly, and <rs

                        division. Well, how was the woman who had been transferred during the night
                        getting along? As far as he was concerned, he didn't really think it was
                        necessary to operate. They would, of course, tell him the result of the

                    <p> He took a cab at the corner, consulting his notebook and pretending to the
                        cabman that he was making up his mind where to go. "To Ottakring" he then
                        said, "take the street going out to Galitzinberg. /'ll tell you where to
                        stop."When he was in the cab he suddenly became terribly restless. In fact,
                        he almost had a guilty conscience, because, during the last few hours, he
                        had nearly forgotten the beautiful woman who had saved him. Would he now
                        find the house? Well, that shouldn't be particularly difficult. The only
                        question was what to do when he had found it. Notify the police? That might
                        have disastrous consequences for the woman who had sacrificed herself for
                        him, or had, at least, been ready to do so. Should he go to a private
                        detective agency? He thought that would be in rather bad taste and not
                        particularly dignified. But what else could he possibly do? He hadn't the
                        time or the skill to make the necessary investigations. A secret club? Well,
                        yes, it certainly was secret, though they seemed to know each other. Were
                        they aristocrats, or perhaps even members of the court? He thought of
                        certain archdukes who might easily be capable of such behavior. And what
                        about the women? Probably they were recruited from brothels. Well, that was
                        not by any means certain, but at any rate, they seemed very attractive. But
                        how about the woman who had sacrificed herself for him? Sacrificed? Why did
                        he try, again and again, to make himself believe that it really was a
                        sacrifice? It had been a joke, of course; the whole thing had been a joke
                        and he ought to be grateful to have gotten out of the scrape so easily.
                        Well, why not? He had preserved his dignity, and the cavaliers probably
                        realized that he was nobody's fool. And she must have realized it also. Very
                        likely she had cared more for him than for all those archdukes or whatever
                        they were.He got out at the end of Liebhartstal, where the road led sharply
                        up-hill, and took the precaution of sending the cab away. There were white
                        clouds in the pale-blue sky and the sun shone with the warmth of spring. He
                        looked back‚Äîthere was nothing suspicious in sight, no cab, no pedestrian. He
                        walked slowly up the road. His coat became heavy. He took it off and threw
                        it over his shoulder just as he came to the spot where he thought the
                        side-street, in which the mysterious house stood, branched off to the right.
                        He could not go wrong. The street went down-hill but not nearly so steeply
                        as it had seemed during the night. It was a quiet little street. There were
                        rosebushes carefully covered with straw in a front garden, and in the next
                        yard stood a baby carriage. A boy in a blue jersey suit was romping about
                        and a laughing young woman watched him from a ground-floor window. Next came
                        an empty lot, then an uncultivated fenced-in garden, then a little villa,
                        next a lawn, and finally‚Äîthere was no doubt about it‚Äîthe house he was
                        looking for. It certainly did not seem large or magnificent. It was a
                        one-story villa in modest Empire style and obviously renovated a
                        comparatively short time before. The green blinds were down and there was
                        nothing to show that anyone lived there. <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin">
                            Fridolin </rs> looked around. There was no one in the street, except
                        farther down where two boys with books under their arms were going in the
                        opposite direction. He stopped in front of the garden gate. And what was he
                        to do now? Simply walk back again? That would be too ridiculous, he thought,
                        looking for the bell-button. Supposing someone answered it, what was he to
                        say? Well, he would simply ask if the pretty country house was to let for
                        the summer. But the house-door had already opened and an old servant in
                        plain morning livery came out and slowly walked down the narrow path to the
                        gate. He held a letter in his hand and silently pushed it through the iron
                        bars to <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> whose heart was
                        beating wildly. <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin"> "For me?" </said>
                        he asked, hesitantly. The servant nodded, went back to the house, and the
                        door closed behind him. What does that mean? <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> asked himself. Can it possibly be from
                        her? Does she, herself, own the house? He walked back up the street quickly
                        and it was only then that he noticed his name on the envelope in large,
                        dignified letters. He opened it, unfolded a sheet and read the
                        following:Give up your inquiries which are perfectly useless, and consider
                        these words a second warning. We hope, for your own good, that this will be
                        sufficient.This message disappointed him in every respect, but at any rate
                        it was different from what he had foolishly expected. Nevertheless, the tone
                        of it was strangely reserved, even kindly, and seemed to show that the
                        people who had sent it by no means felt secure.Second warning‚Äî? How was
                        that? Oh yes, he had received the first one during the night. But why second
                        warning‚Äîand not the last? Did they want to try his courage once more? Was he
                        to pass a test? And how did they know his name? Well, that wasn't difficult.
                        They had probably forced Nachtigall to tell. And besides‚Äîhe smiled at his
                        absent-mindedness‚Äîhis monogram and his full address were sewn into the
                        lining of his fur coat.But, though he had made no progress, the letter on
                        the whole reassured him, just why he couldn't say. At any rate he was
                        convinced that the woman he was so uneasy about was still alive, and that it
                        would be possible to find her if he went about it cautiously and cleverly. </p>

                    <p> He went home, feeling rather tired but with a strange sense of security

                        Albertina </rs> and the child had finished their dinner, but they kept him
                        company while he ate his meal. There she sat opposite him, the woman who had
                        calmly allowed him to be crucified the preceding night. She was sitting
                        there with an angelic look, like a good housewife and mother, and to his
                        surprise he did not hate her. He enjoyed his meal, being in an excited,
                        cheerful mood, and, as he usually did, gave a very lively account of the
                        little professional incidents of the day. He mentioned especially the gossip
                        about the doctors, about whom he always kept <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> well informed. He told her that the
                        appointment of Hugelmann was as good as settled, and then spoke pf his own
                        determination to take up scientific work again with greater energy. <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> knew this mood. She
                        also knew that it usually didn't last very long and betrayed her doubts by a
                        slight smile. When <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        became quite warm on the subject, she gently smoothed his hair to calm him.
                        He started slightly and turned to the child, so as to remove his forehead
                        from the embarrassing touch. He took the little girl on his lap and was just
                        beginning to dance her up and down, when the maid announced that several
                        patients were waiting. Fridolin rose with a sigh of relief, suggesting to <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> that she and the
                        child ought to go for a walk on such a beautiful, sunny afternoon, and went
                        to his consulting room. </p>

                    <p> During the next two hours he had to see six old patients and two new ones.
                        In every single case he had his whole mind on the subject. He made
                        examinations, jotted down notes and wrote prescriptions‚Äîand he was glad that
                        he felt so unusually fresh and clear in mind after spending the last two
                        nights almost without sleep.At the end of his consultation period, he
                        stopped to see his wife and little daughter once more. He noted with
                        satisfaction that <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> 's
                        mother was with her, and that the child was having a French lesson with her
                        governess. It was only when he reached the front steps that he realized that
                        all this order, this regularity, all the security of his existence, was
                        nothing but deception and delusion.Although he had excused himself from his
                        afternoon duties at the hospital, he felt irresistibly drawn to his ward.
                        There were two cases there of special importance to the piece of research he
                        was planning. He was busy for some time making a more detailed study of them
                        than he had yet done, and following that he still had to visit a patient in
                        the heart of the city. It was already seven o'clock in the evening when he
                        stood before the old house in Schreyvogel Strasse. As he looked up at
                        Marianne's window, her image, which had completely faded from his mind, was
                        revived‚Äîmore clearly than that of all the others. Well‚Äî there was no chance
                        of failure here. He could begin his work of vengeance without any special
                        exertion and with little difficulty or danger. What might have deterred
                        others, the betrayal of her fiance, only made him keener. Yes, to betray, to
                        deceive, to lie, to play a part, before <rs type="character" ref="#Marianne">
                        Marianne </rs> , before <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs>
                        , before the good Doctor Roediger, before the whole world. To lead a sort of
                        double life, to be the capable, reliable physician with a future before him,
                        the upright husband and head of a family. And at the same time a libertine,
                        a seducer, a cynic who played with people, with men and women, just as the
                        spirit moved him‚Äî that seemed to him, at the time, very delightful. And the
                        most delightful part was that at some future time, long after <rs

                        secure in the peacefulness of marriage and of‚Äîfamily life‚Äîhe would confess

                        before written the death certificate of the Councilor. A little lamp was
                        burning on the writing desk, and it was nearly dark. Marianne offered him a

                        shoulders drooped when he continued almost harshly: <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "I think that's very
                        sensible." </said> And he explained in a matter-of-fact way what a favorable
                        effect the good air and the new environment would have on her.>She sat
                        motionless, and tears streamed down her cheeks. He saw them, feeling
                        impatient rather than sympathetic. The thought that the next minute,
                        perhaps, she might be lying at his feet, repeating her confession of the
                        night before, filled him with fear. When she said nothing he got up
                        suddenly. "Much as I regret it, Fraulein Marianne‚Äî" He looked at his
                        watch.Still crying, she raised her head and looked at <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> . He would gladly have said something
                        kind to her, but found it difficult to do so. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "I suppose you will stay
                        in the country for several days," </said> he began rather awkwardly. <said
                            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "I hope you
                        will write to me ... By the way, Doctor Roediger says the wedding is to be
                        soon. Let me offer you my best wishes." </said> She did not move, as though
                        she had understood neither his congratulations nor his farewell. He held out
                        his hand but she refused it, and he repeated almost reproachfully: <said
                            aloud="true" direct="true" who="Fridolin" toWhom="Marianne"> "Well then,
                        I sincerely hope that you will keep me posted about your health. Good-bye,
                        Fraulein Marianne." </said> She sat there as if turned to stone and he left
                        the room, stopping for a second in the doorway, as though to give her a last
                        opportunity to call him back. But she turned her head away, and he closed
                        the door behind him. When he was out in the hallway he felt rather
                        remorseful and for a moment he thought of going back, but he felt that it
                        would have been ridiculous to do so.But what was he to do now? Go home?
                        Where else could he go? Anyhow, there was nothing more he could do today.
                        And what about tomorrow? What could he do and how should he go about it? He
                        felt awkward and helpless. Everything he put his hands to turned out a
                        failure. Everything seemed unreal: his home, his wife, his child, his
                        profession, and even he himself, mechanically walking along through the
                        nocturnal streets with his thoughts roaming through space. The clock on the
                        Rathaus tower struck half past seven. It didn't matter how late it was; he
                        had more time on his hands than he needed. There was nothing and no one that
                        interested him, and he pitied himself not a little. Then the idea occurred
                        to him ‚Äînot deliberately but as a flash across his mind‚Äîto drive to some
                        station, take a train, no matter where, and to disappear, leaving everyone
                        behind. He could then turn up again, somewhere abroad, and start a new life,
                        as a different personality. He recalled certain strange pathological cases
                        which he had read in books on psychiatry, so called double-lives. A man
                        living in normal circumstances suddenly disappeared, was not heard from,
                        returned months or years later and didn't remember where he had been during
                        this time. Later, however, someone who had run across him, somewhere, in a
                        foreign country, recognized him, but the man himself remembered nothing.
                        Such things certainly didn't happen very often, but just the same they were
                        authentic. Many others probably experienced the same things in a lesser
                        degree. For instance, when one comes back out of dreams. Of course, one
                        remembers some dreams, but there must be others one completely forgets, of
                        which nothing remains but a mysterious mood, a curious numbness. Or one
                        doesn't remember until very much later, and doesn't even then know whether
                        it was real or only a dream. Only a dream! </p>

                    <p> While <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> wandered along,
                        drifting aimlessly towards his home, he entered the neighborhood of the
                        dark, rather questionable street, where he had accompanied the forlorn
                        little girl to her humble room less than twenty-four hours before. Why was
                        she "forlorn?" And why was just this street "questionable?" Isn't it strange
                        how we are misled by words, how we give names to streets, events and people,
                        and form judgments about them, just because we are too lazy to change our
                        habits? Wasn't this young girl in reality the most charming, if not actually
                        the purest of all those with whom he had come in contact during the past
                        night? He felt rather touched when he thought of her, and remembering his
                        plan of the night before, he turned into the nearest store and bought all
                        kinds of delicacies. Walking along with his package, the consciousness of
                        performing an act which was at least sensible, and perhaps actually
                        laudable, made him feel glad. Nevertheless, he turned up his coat collar
                        when he stepped into the hallway and went upstairs several steps at a time.
                        The bell of the apartment rang with unwelcome shrillness and he felt
                        relieved when a disreputable looking woman informed him that Fraulein Mizzi
                        was not at home. But before the woman had an opportunity of taking charge of
                        the package for Mizzi, another woman joined them. She was still young and
                        not bad-looking, and had on a sort of bath-robe. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="woman" toWhom="Fridolin"> "Whom are you looking for?" </said>

                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> . Her lips were half open, and as she
                        boldly drew up her voluptuous body the bath-robe parted. <rs

                            who="Fridolin" toWhom="woman"> "In which ward is she?" </said> The

                        several years before, and added good-naturedly: <said aloud="true"

                            true to her." </said> She stepped closer to him and laughed invitingly
                        but when he drew back a little she gave it up at once and said, as if to
                        console him: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="woman" toWhom="Fridolin">
                        "The

                        street he felt choked with tears. He knew that this was not because he was
                        deeply affected, but because his nerves were gradually giving way, and he
                        intentionally struck up a quicker and more lively pace than he was in the
                        mood for. Was this another and final sign that everything was bound to turn
                        out a failure for him? But why should it? The fact that he had escaped such
                        a great danger might just as well be a good sign. Was it the all-important
                        thing to escape danger? He could expect to face many others, as he was by no
                        means ready to give up the search for the marvelous woman of the night
                        before.Of course, it was too late to do anything about it now. Besides, he
                        had to consider carefully just how to continue the search.If only there were
                        someone he could consult in the matter! But he knew of no one to whom he was
                        willing to confide his adventures of the preceding night. For years he had
                        not exchanged confidences with anyone except his wife, and of course, he
                        could hardly discuss this case with her. Neither this nor any other. For, no
                        matter how one looked at it, she had permitted him to be crucified the night
                        before.And he suddenly realized why he was walking, not towards his house,
                        but, unconsciously, farther and farther in the opposite direction. He would
                        not, and could not, face <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs>
                        now. The most sensible tiling to do was to have supper away from home, then
                        he could go to his ward and look after his two cases. But under no
                        circumstances would he go home‚Äî"home?"‚Äîuntil he could be certain of finding
                        Albertina asleep. </p>

                    <p> He entered a cafe, one of the more quiet and select ones near the Rathaus.
                        He telephoned home not to expect him for supper, and hung up the receiver
                        quickly so that <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs>
                        wouldn't have a chance to come to the phone.Then he sat down by a window and
                        drew the curtain. A man had just taken a seat in a distant corner. He wore a
                        dark overcoat and inconspicuous clothes and <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Fridolin">
                            Fridolin </rs> thought he had seen his face before, during the day. It
                        might, of course, be just a fancy. He picked up an evening paper, read a few
                        lines here and there, just as he had done the night before in a different
                        place. Reports on political events, articles on the theatre, art and
                        literature, accounts of accidents and disasters. In some city that he had
                        never heard of in the United States a theatre had burned down. Peter Korand,
                        a chimney-sweep, had thrown himself out of a window. Somehow, it seemed
                        strange to <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> that even
                        chimney-sweeps occasionally commit suicide. Involuntarily he wondered
                        whether the man had first washed himself properly or whether he had plunged
                        into nothingness just as he was, black and dirty. A woman had taken poison
                        that morning in a fashionable hotel in the heart of the city. She was an
                        unusually good-looking woman and had registered there a few days before
                        under the name of Baroness D. At once <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
                        Fridolin </rs> felt a strange presentiment. The woman had returned to the
                        hotel at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men who had left
                        her at the door. Four o'clock! That was exactly the time that he, too, had
                        reached home. About noontime‚Äîthe account continued‚Äîshe had been found
                        unconscious in her bed with every indication of serious poisoning. . . . An
                        unusually good-looking woman. . . . Well, there were many unusually
                        good-looking women. . . . There was no reason to believe that Baroness D.,
                        or rather the woman who had registered as such, and a certain other person,
                        were one and the same. And yet‚Äîhis heart throbbed and his hand trembled as
                        it held the paper. In a fashionable hotel . . . which one‚Äî? Why so
                        mysterious?‚Äîso discreet? . . .He put the paper down and at the same time the
                        man in the far corner raised his, a large, illustrated journal, and held it
                        to shield his face. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> at
                        once picked up his paper again and decided that the Baroness D. must
                        certainly be the woman he had seen the night before. In a fashionable hotel.
                        . . . There were not many which would be considered‚Äîby a Baroness D. . . .
                        Whatever happened now, this clue had to be followed up. He called for the
                        waiter, paid his bill and left. At the door he turned to look for the
                        suspicious character in the corner, but strange to say, he was already gone.
                        . . .Serious poisoning. . . . But she was still living. . . . She was living
                        when they found her. There was really no reason to suppose that she had not
                        been saved. In any case, he would find her‚Äîwhether she lived or not. And he
                        would see her‚Äîdead or alive. He would see her; no one in the world could
                        stop his seeing the woman who had died on his account; who had, in fact,
                        died for him. He was the cause of her death‚Äî he alone‚Äîif it were she. Yes,
                        it was she. Returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning,
                        accompanied by two men! Very likely the same men who had taken <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Nachtigall </rs> to the station a few
                        hours later. This did not seem to point to a very clear conscience.He stood
                        in the large Square before the Rathaus and looked around. There were only a
                        few people in sight and the suspicious looking man from the cafe was not
                        among them. But even if he were‚Äîthe men had been afraid‚Äî <rs

                        a cab when he reached the Ring, and driving first to the Hotel Bristol,
                        asked the concierge, as though he were fully authorized to do so, whether

                        poison that morning, had stopped at this hotel. The concierge didn't seem at

                        found that Baroness D. had been taken to the General Hospital immediately
                        after they found her. He also inquired how they had discovered her attempt
                        at suicide. Why had they disturbed at noon a lady who had not returned until
                        four in the morning? Well, it was quite simple; two men (the two men again!)
                        had asked for her at eleven o'clock in the morning. The lady had not
                        answered her telephone, although they had rung several times, and when the
                        maid knocked on her door, there was no answer. It was locked on the inside.
                        Finally, they had had to break it open, and they found the Baroness in her
                        bed, unconscious. They had at once called an ambulance and notified the

                        He felt like a detective.Yes, of course the two men looked rather
                        suspicious. In the meantime they had completely disappeared. Anyhow, it was
                        unlikely that she was really the <rs type="character" ref="#Baroness">
                        Baroness Dubieski </rs> , the name under which she had registered. This was
                        the first time she had stopped at the hotel. Besides, there wasn't a family
                        by that name; at least none belonging to the nobility. </p>

                        come up and looked him over with unpleasant curiosity. He got back into the
                        cab and told the cabman to take him to the hospital. A few minutes later, in
                        the outside office, he learned that the allege <rs type="character"
                            ref="#Baroness"> Baroness Dubieski </rs> had been taken to the second
                        clinic for internal medicine. In spite of all the efforts of the doctors,
                        she had died at five in the afternoon‚Äî without having regained

                        <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> breathed a sigh of
                        relief that sounded now like a deep groan. The official on duty looked up,
                        startled, and <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> pulled
                        himself together and courteously took his leave. A minute later he stood
                        again out-doors. The hospital park was empty except where a nurse, in her
                        blue and white uniform and cap, was walking along a near-by path. <said

                        is she. And if it is not? If she still lives, how can I find her? Only too
                        easily could <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> answer the
                        question as to where at that moment he could find the body of the unknown
                        woman. As she had died so recently, she was undoubtedly lying in the
                        hospital morgue, a few hundred paces away. As a doctor, there would, of
                        course, be no difficulty in gaining admittance there, even at such a late
                        hour. But‚Äîwhat did he want there? He had never seen her face, only her body.
                        He had only snatched a hasty glance at the former when he had been driven
                        out. Up to this moment he hadn't thought of that fact. During the time since
                        he had read the account in the paper he had pictured the suicide, whose face
                        he didn't know, as having the features of <rs type="character"

                            Albertina </rs> . In fact, he now shuddered to realize that his wife had
                        constantly been in his mind's eye as the woman he was seeking. He asked
                        himself again why he really wanted to go to the morgue. He was sure that if
                        he had met her again alive‚Äîwhether days or years later, whatever the
                        circumstances‚Äîhe would unquestionably have recognized her by her gait, her
                        bearing, and above all by her voice. But now he was to see only the body
                        again, the dead body of a woman, and a face of which he remembered only the
                        eyes, now lifeless. Yes‚Äîhe knew those eyes, and the hair which had suddenly
                        become untied and had enveloped her naked body as they had driven him from

                        the face of a woman of eighteen, as of thirty-eight. <said aloud="true"
                            direct="true" who="Adler" toWhom="Fridolin"> "Is it she?" </said> asked <rs

                            ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> bent lower, as though he could, with his
                        piercing look, wrest an answer from the rigid features. Yet at the same time
                        he knew that if it were her face, and her eyes, the eyes that had shone at
                        him the day before with so much passion, he would not, could not‚Äîand in
                        reality did not, want to know. He gently laid the head back on the table.
                        His eyes followed the moving flashlight, passing along the dead body. Was it
                        her body?‚Äîthe wonderful alluring body for which, only yesterday, he had felt
                        such agonizing desire? <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs>
                        touched the forehead, the cheeks, the shoulders and arms of the dead woman,
                        doing so as if compelled and directed by an invisible power. He twined his
                        fingers about those of the corpse, and rigid as they were, they seemed to
                        him to make an effort to move, to seize his hand. Indeed, he almost felt
                        that a vague and distant look from underneath her eyelids was searching his
                        face. He bent over her, as if magically attracted.Suddenly he heard a voice
                        behind him whispering: <said aloud="true" direct="true" who="Adler"

                        instantly. He freed his fingers from those of the corpse, and taking her
                        thin wrists, placed the ice-cold arms alongside of the body very carefully,
                        even a little scrupulously. It seemed to him that she had just at that
                        moment died. He turned away, directed his steps to the door and across the
                        resounding hallway back into the room which they had left a little while
                        before. Doctor Adler followed in silence and locked the door behind them. <rs
                            type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> stepped up to the

                        without further ceremony. He switched on his microscope lamp, turned the
                        micrometer screw and looked into the microscope. When <rs type="character"

                        whether the woman‚Äînow lying in the hospital morgue‚Äîwas the same one he had
                        held naked in his arms twenty-four hours before, to the wild tunes of
                        Nachtigall's playing. It was immaterial whether this corpse was some other
                        unknown woman, a perfect stranger whom he had never seen before. Even if the
                        woman he had sought, desired and perhaps loved for an hour were still alive,

                        the dark and empty streets. After undressing in the consultation room, as he
                        had done twenty-four hours before, he entered the bedroom as silently as
                        possible. </p>
                    <p> He heard <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> breathing
                        quietly and regularly and saw the outlines of her head on the soft pillow.
                        Unexpectedly, his heart was filled with a feeling of tenderness and even of
                        security. He decided to tell her the story of the preceding night very soon‚Äî
                        perhaps even the next day‚Äîbut to tell it as though everything he had
                        experienced had been a dream. Then, when she had fully realized the utter
                        futility of his adventures, he would confess to her that they had been real.
                        Real? he asked himself‚Äîand at this moment he noticed something dark quite
                        near <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina"> Albertina </rs> 's face. It had
                        definite outlines like the shadowy features of a human face, and it was
                        lying on his pillow. For a moment his heart stopped beating, but an instant
                        later he saw what it was, and stretching out his hand, picked up the mask he
                        had worn the night before. He must have lost it in the morning when making
                        up his bundle, and the maid or <rs type="character" ref="#Albertina">
                        Albertina </rs> herself had found it. Undoubtedly <rs type="character"

                            Albertina </rs> , after making this find, suspected
                        something‚Äîpresumably, more and worse things than had actually happened. And
                        she intimated this, by placing the mask on the pillow beside her, as though
                        it signified his face, the face of her husband who had become an enigma to
                        her. This playful, almost joking action seemed to express both a gentle
                        warning and her readiness to forgive. <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">
                        Fridolin </rs> confidently hoped that, remembering her own dream, she would
                        not be inclined to take his too seriously, no matter what might have
                        happened. All at once, however, he reached the end of his strength. He
                        dropped the mask, uttered a loud and painful sob‚Äîquite unexpectedly‚Äîsank
                        down beside the bed, buried his head in the pillows, and wept.A few minutes
                        later he felt a soft hand caressing his hair. He looked up and from the
                        depths of his heart he cried: <said

                        took it and held it, and looked at her both questioningly and beseechingly.
                        She encouraged him with a nod and he began his story.The gray dawn was
                        creeping in through the curtains when <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin">

                        hadn't once interrupted him with a curious or impatient question. She
                        probably felt that he could not, and would not, keep anything from her. She
                        lay there quietly, with her arms folded under her head, and remained silent
                        long after <rs type="character" ref="#Fridolin"> Fridolin </rs> had
                        finished. He was lying by her side and finally bent over her, and looking
                        into her immobile face with the large, bright eyes in which morning seemed
                        to have dawned, he asked, in a voice of both doubt and hope: <said
